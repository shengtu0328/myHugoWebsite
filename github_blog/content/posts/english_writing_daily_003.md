I do believe in people being able to do what they want to do succesfully, providing they're committed to this thing and pay considerable time and effort.





Last 2 weeks,I browsed many job openings on several job sites. Sensing there's still chances for developer job perfered in english literally, i decides to practice learing English consictencely.



i need to prepare for interview more sufficiently for making a good performance because this is the most difficult time i have even encounter. Many resumes submitted was no answer.



i  am aware of  there do have rare opportunities in hunting a job for me .but i reamain committed to this well-planned approach for **as long as necessary.**



As you know，last 2 weeks，I only update 2 videos about learing english. i make a desicsion to update the video about reading in english  once a day to develop a habit in this long-term **preparation**.even if the post is short.
