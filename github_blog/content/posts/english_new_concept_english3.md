## Lesson 1 A puma at large 逃遁的美洲狮

Pumas are large, cat-like animals which are found in America. When reports came into London Zoo that a wild puma had been spotted forty-five miles south of London, they were not taken seriously. However（加了逗号however是副词，没有逗号当连词用）, as the evidence began to accumulate, experts from the Zoo felt obliged to investigate, for the descriptions given by people who claimed to have seen the puma were extraordinarily similar.

The hunt for the puma began in a small village where a woman picking blackberries saw 'a large cat' only five yards away from her. It immediately ran away when she saw it, and experts confirmed （confirmed跟了一个宾语从句）that a puma will （宾语从句这里用will 因为这句话是一个客观事实）not attack a human being unless it is cornered. The search proved （prove是系动词 ）difficult, for the puma was often observed at one place in the morning and at another place twenty miles away in the evening. Wherever it went, it left behind it a trail of dead deer and small animals like rabbits. Paw prints were seen in a number of places and puma fur was found clinging to bushes. Several people complained of "cat-like noises' at night and a businessman on a fishing trip saw the puma up a tree. The experts were now fully convinced that the animal was a puma, but where had it come from? As no pumas had been reported missing from any zoo in the country, this one must have been （ must have been 不是虚拟语气 表示推测）in the possession of a private collector and somehow managed to escape. The hunt went on for several weeks, but the puma was not caught. It is disturbing to think that a dangerous wild animal is still at large in the quiet countryside.

**Notes on the text 课文注释**

1 at large是介词短语，此处表示“逍遥自在”、“行动自由”的意思。
2 When reports came into London Zoo that a wild puma had been spotted forty-five miles south of London, 当伦敦动物园接到报告说，在伦敦以南45英里的地方发现一头野生美洲狮时。这个从句中以that引导的从句是reports的同位语，用于进一步说明报告的内容。

 However（加了逗号however是副词，没有逗号当连词用）, as the evidence began to accumulate, experts from the Zoo felt obliged to investigate, for the descriptions given by people who claimed to have seen the puma were extraordinarily similar.

 as the evidence began to accumulate,

, for the descriptions given by people who claimed to have seen the puma were extraordinarily similar.

这两句都是状语从句， claimed to have seen 不定式 to haven seen动作的发生比claimed 要早



在英语中，**"forty-five miles south of London"** 这种表达方式中不需要加介词。这是因为“south of London”已经是一个方位短语，表示“在伦敦以南”的位置。“forty-five miles”则进一步修饰了这个方位，表示具体的距离。

所以，整个短语 **"forty-five miles south of London"** 可以直接理解为“距离伦敦南方45英里处”，不需要额外的介词。

不过，如果你用介词，也可以，比如：

- **"at a location forty-five miles south of London"**  
  但这会使表达更冗长，通常不这样说。直接使用“forty-five miles south of London”更简洁和自然。

这种结构在英语中很常见，例如：

- **"ten kilometers east of the city"** （在城市以东十公里处）

**参考译文**

美洲狮是一种体形似猫的大动物，产于美洲。当伦敦动物园接到报告说，在伦敦以南45英里处发现一只美洲狮时，这些报告并没有受到重视。可是，随着证据越来越多，动物园的专家们感到有必要进行一番调查，因为凡是声称见到过美洲狮的人们所描述的情况竟是出奇地相似。

pumas are large,cat-like animasl.which are found in america.when the report  came into london zoo that a puma had been spotted froty-five miles  south of london.  these reports were not taken seriously. howerver,as the  evidence began to accumlate,.the expert  from zoo felt obliged to investigate,for the discription given  by people who claimed to have seeen the puma were extraordinarily similar.

**搜寻**美洲狮的工作是从一座小村庄开始的。那里的一位妇女在采摘黑莓时的看见“一只大猫”，离她仅5码远，她刚看见它，它就立刻逃走了。专家证实，美洲狮非被逼得走投无路，是决不会伤人的。事实上搜寻工作很困难，因为常常是早晨在甲地发现那只美洲狮，晚上却在20英里外的乙地发现它的踪迹。无论它**走**哪儿，一路上总会留下一串死鹿及死兔子之类的小动物，在许多地方看见爪印，灌木丛中发现了粘在上面的美洲狮**毛**。有人抱怨说夜里听见“像猫一样的叫声”；一位商人去钓鱼，看见那只美洲狮在树上。专家们如今已经完全肯定那只动物就是美洲狮，但它是从哪儿来的呢？由于全国动物园没有一家报告丢了美洲狮，因此那只美洲狮一定是某位私人收藏豢养的，不知怎么**设法**逃出来了。搜寻工作**进行**了好几个星期，但始终未能逮住那只美洲狮。想到在宁静的乡村里有一头危险的野兽继续逍遥流窜，真令人**担心**。

the hunt for pumas began in a small village  where a women picking blackberries saw a large cat  only 5 yards away from her.

 when she saw it, it **ran away** immediately.  the experts confirmed that puma will not attack people unless it is corned. 

in the fact, the searching proved difficult.

,for the puma  was often observed at one place in the morning and at another place twenty miles away  in the evening . 

Wherever it went,，it left behind it a trail of dead deer and  small animal like rabbit  ,  

Paw prints were seen in **a number of** places and puma **fur** was found clinging to bushes.

serveal people complained of  cat-like nosie at night 。a businessman on a fishing-trip saw a puma up a tree.

the experts were now fully convienced that  the animal was puam,but where had it come from.

because no pumas has been report missing  from any zoo in the country,this one must have been in the possession of a private collector and somehow managed to escape.

. The hunt **went on** for several weeks, but the puma was not caught.it is disturbting to  think that a dangerous beast is still at large in the quiet countryside.



## Lesson 2 Thirteen equals one 十三等于一



Our vicar is always raising money for one cause or another, but he has never managed （to get enough money )(to have the church clock repaired状语). The big clock which used to strike the hours day and night was damaged many years ago and has been silent ever since.

One night, however, our vicar woke up with a start: the clock was striking the hours! Looking at his watch, he saw that it was one o'clock, but the bell struck thirteen times before it stopped. Armed with a torch, the vicar went up into the clock tower to see what was going on. In the torchlight, he caught sight of a figure whom he immediately recognized as Bill Wilkins, our local grocer.

'Whatever are you doing up here Bill?' asked the vicar in surprise.
'I'm trying to repair the bell,' answered Bill. 'I've been coming up here night after night for weeks now. You see, I was hoping to give you a surprise.'
'You certainly did give me a surprise!' said the vicar. 'You've probably woken up everyone in the village as well. Still, I'm glad the bell is working again.'
That's the trouble, vicar,' answered Bill. 'It's working all right, but I'm afraid that at one o'clock it will strike thirteen times and there's nothing I can do about it."
We'll get used to that, Bill,' said the vicar. "Thirteen is not as good as one, but it's better than nothing. Now let's go downstairs and have a cup of tea.'

## Lesson 3 An unknown goddess 无名女神



Some time ago, an interesting discovery was made by archaeologists on the Aegean island of Kea. An American team explored a temple which stands in an ancient city on the promontory of Ayia Irini. The city at one time must have been prosperous, for it enjoyed a high level of civilization. Houses, often three storeys high, were built of stone. They had large rooms with beautifully decorated walls. The city was even equipped with a drainage system, for a great many clay pipes were found beneath the narrow streets.

The temple which the archaeologists explored was used as a place of worship from the 15th century B.C. until Roman times. In the most sacred room of the temple, clay fragments of 15 statues were found. Each of these represented a goddess **and had, at one time, been painted.**

The body of one statue was found among remains dating from the 15th century B.C. Its missing head happened to be among remains of the 5th century B.C. This head must have been found in Classical times and carefully preserved. It was very old and precious even then. When the archaeologists reconstructed the fragments, they were amazed to find(amazed  原因状语) that the goddess turned out to be(the goddess主语补语） a very modern-looking woman. She stood three feet high and her hands rested on her hips.

She was wearing a full-length skirt which swept the ground. Despite her great age, she was very graceful indeed, but, so far, the archaeologists have been unable to discover her identity.

## Lesson 4 The double life of Alfred Bloggs

These days, people who do manual work often receive far（far是副词） more money than people who work in offices. People who work in offices are frequently referred to as "white-collar workers' for the simple reason that they usually wear a collar and tie to go to work. Such is human nature, that a great many people are often willing to sacrifice higher pay for the privilege of becoming white-collar workers. **This can give rise to curious situations, as it did in the case of Alfred Bloggs who worked as a dustman for the Ellesmere Corporation.**

When he got married, Alf was too embarrassed to say anything to his wife about his job. He simply told her that he worked for the Corporation. Every morning, he left home dressed in a smart black suit. He then changed into overalls and spent the next eight hours as a dustman. Before returning home at night. He took a shower and changed back into his suit. Alf did this for over two years and his fellow dustmen kept his secret Alf's wife has never discovered that she married a dustman and she never will, for Alf has just found another job. He will soon be working in an office. He will be earning only half as much as he used to, but he feels that his rise in status is well worth the loss of money. From now on, he will wear a suit all day and others will call him 'Mr. Bloggs', not 'Alf'.

##  Lesson 5 The facts 确切数字


Editors of newspapers and magazines often go to extremes to provide their readers with unimportant facts and statistics. Last year a journalist had been instructed by a well-known magazine to write an article on the president's palace in a new African republic. When the article arrived, the editor read the first sentence and then refused to publish it. The article began: ‘Hundreds of steps lead to the high wall which surrounds the president's palace. ’The editor at once sent the journalist a fax instructing（现在分词作后置定语） him to find out the exact number of steps and the height of the wall.

 The journalist immediately set out to obtain these important facts, but he took a long time to send them Meanwhile, the editor was getting impatient, for the magazine would(使用 "would soon" 是因为主句使用了过去时态) soon go to press. He sent the journalist two more faxes, but received no reply. He sent yet（**yet**作副词，adv. 又） another fax informing the journalist that if he did not reply soon he would be fired. When the journalist again failed to reply, the editor reluctantly published the article as it had originally been written. A week later, the editor at last received a fax from the journalist. Not only had the poor man been arrested, but he had been sent to prison as well. However, he had at last been allowed to send a fax in which he informed the editor that the he had been arrested while counting the 1,084 steps leading to the fifteen-foot wall which surrounded the president's palace.

## Lesson 6 Smash-and-grab 砸橱窗抢劫

The expensive shops in a famous arcade near Piccadilly were just opening. At this time of the morning, the arcade was almost empty. Mr. Taylor, the owner of a jewellery shop was admiring a new window display. Two of his assistants had been working busily since eight o'clock and had only just finished. Diamond necklaces and rings had been beautifully arranged on a background of black velvet. After gazing at the display for several minutes, Mr. Taylor went back into his shop.

The silence was suddenly broken when a large car, with its headlights on and its horn blaring, roared down the arcade. It came to a stop outside the jeweller's. One man stayed at the wheel while two others with black stockings over their faces jumped out and smashed the window of the shop with iron bars. While this was going on, Mr. Taylor was upstairs. He and his staff began throwing furniture out of the window. Chairs and tables went flying into the arcade. One of the thieves was struck by a heavy statue, but he was too busy helping himself to diamonds to notice any pain. The raid was all over in three minutes, for the men scrambled back into the car and it moved off at a fantastic speed. Just as it was leaving, Mr. Taylor rushed out and ran after it throwing ashtrays and vases, but it was impossible to stop the thieves. They had got away with thousands of pounds worth of diamonds.

1 Piccadilly, 皮卡迪利，这是伦敦市中心一条著名的街。这条街从海德公园通向一个著名的广场，叫作“皮卡迪利广场”。
2 with its headlights on and its horn blaring, …这是 with引导的独立主格结构，在句中表示伴随状况。
3 but he was too busy helping himself to diamonds to notice any pain.但他只顾忙着抢劫钻石，根本顾不上疼痛了。这里 **help oneself to sth**. 是“擅自取用，侵占某物”的意思。

"helping himself" 是一个动名词短语，作为 "was too busy" 的宾语补足语，

moved off

**参考译文**

皮卡迪利大街附近的一条著名拱廊街道上，几家**高档**商店刚刚开始**营业**。在早晨的这个时候，拱廊街上**几乎空无一人**。珠宝店主泰勒先生正在欣赏**新布置**的橱窗。他**手下**两名店员从早上8点就开始忙碌，这时**刚刚**  **布置**完毕。钻石项链、戒指漂亮地**陈列**在黑色丝绒上面。泰勒先生站在橱窗外**凝神欣赏**了几分钟**就回到了**店里。

The expensive shops in a famous arcade near Piccadilly **were just opening**.

At this time of the morning, the arcade was almost empty.

Mr. Taylor, the owner of a jewellery shop was admiring a new window display. 

Two of his assistants had been working busily since eight o'clock and had **only just** finished. 

Diamond necklaces and rings had been beautifully **arranged** on a background of black **velvet**. 

After **gazing** at the display for several minutes, Mr. Taylor went back into his shop.

宁静突然被打破，一辆大轿车亮着前灯，响着喇叭，**呼啸**着冲进了拱廊街，在珠宝店门口停了下来。一人**留**在**驾驶座**上，另外两个用黑色长筒丝袜**蒙面**的人跳下车来。他们用铁棒把商店橱窗玻璃砸碎。这一切发生时，泰勒先生正在楼上。他与店员动手向窗外投掷家具，椅子、桌子飞落到拱廊街上。一个窃贼被一尊很重的雕像击中，但由于他忙着抢钻石首饰，竟连疼痛都顾不上了。这场抢劫只持续了3分钟，因为窃贼**争先恐后地**爬上轿车，以**惊人**的速度**开跑**了。就在轿车离开的时候，泰勒先生从店里冲了出来，跟在车后追赶，**一边**还往车上扔烟灰缸、花瓶。但他已无法抓住那些窃贼了。他们已经带着价值数千镑的首饰**逃之夭夭**了。

The silence was suddenly broken **when** a large car, with its headlights on and its **horn** **blaring**, **roared down** the arcade. It **came to a stop** outside the jeweller's. 

One man stayed **at the wheel** while **two others** with black stockings over their faces jumped out and smashed the window of the shop with iron **bars**.

While this **was going on,** Mr. Taylor was upstairs.

He and his staff began throwing furniture out of the window. Chairs and tables went flying into the arcade.

One of the  thieves was struck by a heavy statue, but he was too busy helping himself  to diamonds  to notice any pain.

The **raid** **was all over** in three minutes, for the men scrambled back into the car and it **moved off** at a **fantastic** speed.

## Lesson 7 Mutilated ladies 残钞鉴别组

Has it ever happened to you? Have you ever put your trousers in the washing machine and then remembered there was a large bank note in your back pocket? When you rescued your trousers, did you find the note was whiter than white? People who live in Britain needn't despair when they make mistakes like this(and a lot of people do)! Fortunately for them, the Bank of England has a team called Mutilated Ladies which deals with claims from people who fed their money to a machine or to their dog. **Dogs, it seems, love to chew up money!**

A recent case concerns Jane Butlin whose fiancé, John, runs a successful furniture business. John had a very good day and put his wallet containing ￡ 3, 000 into the microwave oven for safekeeping. Then he and Jane went horse-riding. When they got home, Jane cooked their dinner in the microwave oven and without realizing it, cooked her fiancé's wallet as well. Imagine their dismay when they found a beautifully-cooked wallet and notes turned to ash! John went to see his bank manager who sent the remains of wallet and the money to the special department of the Bank of England in Newcastle: the Mutilated Ladies! They examined the remains and John got all his money back. ‘So long as there's something to identify, we will give people their money back, ’said a spokeswoman for the Bank. ‘Last year, we paid ￡ 1. 5m on 21, 000 claims. ’

\* Damaged bank notes. The Queen's head appears on English bank notes，and‘lady’refers to this.

1 Mutilated ladies，这是英国银行专门负责识别和鉴定残缺或被毁纸币的小组，其中的 lady是指英国纸币上印的女王头像。
2 a large bank note，面额很大的纸币。
3 whiter than white，这是英国有关洗衣粉的电视广告中常用的一句话。这里的意思是纸币上的字迹、图案均被洗掉了，可以译为“比白纸还白”。
4 they found a beautifully-cooked wallet and notes turned to ash，他们发现一只煮得很好看的钱包，钞票已烧成了灰。后半句 they found… notes turned to ash中过去分词短语 turned to ash作宾语 notes的补足语，这后半句话可以看成 they found… that notes had been turned to ash。

## Lesson 8 A famous monastery 著名的修道院



The Great St. Bernard Pass connects Switzerland to Italy. At 2, 473 metres, it is the highest mountain pass in Europe. The famous monastery of St. Bernard, which was founded in the eleventh century, lies about a mile away. For hundreds of years, St. Bernard dogs have saved the lives of travellers crossing the dangerous Pass. These friendly dogs, which were first brought from Asia, were used as watchdogs even in Roman times. **Now that** a tunnel has been built through the mountains, the Pass is less dangerous, but each year, the dogs are still sent out into the snow whenever a traveller is in difficulty. Despite the new tunnel, there are still a few people who rashly attempt to cross the Pass on foot.

During the summer months, the monastery is very busy, for it is visited by thousands of people who cross the Pass in cars. As there are so many people about, the dogs have to be kept in a special enclosure. In winter, however, life at the monastery is quite different. The temperature drops to-30°and very few people attempt to cross the Pass. The monks prefer winter to summer for they have more privacy. The dogs have greater freedom, too, for they are allowed to wander outside their enclosure. The only regular visitors to the monastery in winter are parties of skiers who go there at Christmas and Easter. These young people, who love the peace of the mountains, always receive a warm welcome at St. Bernard's monastery.

## Lesson 9 Flying cats 飞猫


How do cats try to protect themselves when falling from great heights?

Cats never fail to fascinate human beings. They can be friendly and **affectionate** towards humans, but they **lead** mysterious lives of their own as well. They never become **submissive** like dogs and horses. As a result, humans have learned to respect **feline** independence. Most cats remain **suspicious** of humans all their lives. One of the things that fascinates us most about cats is the popular belief that they have nine lives. Apparently, there is **a good deal of** truth in this idea. A cat's ability to survive falls is based on fact.

Recently the New York Animal Medical Centre made a study of 132 cats over a period of five months. All these cats had one experience in common: they had fallen off high buildings, **yet** only eight of them died from shock or injuries. Of course, New York is the ideal place for such an interesting study, because there is **no shortage of** tall buildings. There are plenty of **high-rise** **windowsills** to fall, from! One cat, Sabrina, fell 32 **storeys**, yet only **suffered from** a broken tooth. ‘Cats behave like well-trained **paratroopers**, ’ a doctor said. It seems that the further cats fall, the less they **are likely to** injure themselves. In a long drop, they reach speeds of 60 miles an hour and more. At high speeds, falling cats have time to relax. They stretch out their legs like flying squirrels. This increases their air-resistance and reduces the shock of impact when they hit the ground.

**New words and expressions 生词和短语**

**Notes on the text 课文注释**

1 Cats never fail to fascinate human beings. 在这句话中有一个否定词 never和一个含有否定意义的动词 fail，这两个否定词就组成了双重否定，而双重否定往往用来表示肯定。这句话可以译成：“猫总能引起人们的极大兴趣。”
2 be based on，在……基础之上。
3 have in common，有共同之处。
4 the further cats fall, the less they are likely to injure themselves，猫跌落的距离越长，它们就越不会伤害自己。“the +形容词或副词比较级…the +形容词或副词比较级”的结构常用来表示比较关系，往往可以译成“越……越……”。 be likely to是“很可能会”的意思。

**参考译文**

猫总能引起人们的极大兴趣。它们可以**对人**友好，充满柔情。但是，它们又有自己神秘的生活方式。它们从不**像**狗和马一样变得那么顺从。**结果是**人们已经学会尊重猫的独立性。**在它们的一生中**，大多数猫都**对**人存有戒心。最使我们**感兴趣**的一件事情就是一种**通俗的信念**——猫有九条命。显然，这种**说法**里面包含着许多真实性。猫在跌落时能够**大难不死**是有事实作为依据的。

## Lesson 10 The loss of the Titanic ＂泰坦尼克＂号的沉没


What would have happened if only two of the sixteen water-tight compartments had been flooded?

The great ship, Titanic, **sailed for** New York from Southampton on April 10th, 1912. She was carrying 1, 316 passengers and a crew of 891. Even by modern standards, the 46, 000 ton Titanic was a **colossal** ship**. At that time**, however, she was not only the largest ship that had ever been built, but was regarded as unsinkable, for she had sixteen **watertight** **compartments**. Even if two of these were **flooded**, she would still be able to float. The tragic sinking of this great **liner** will always be remembered, for she went down on her first **voyage** with heavy loss of life.

Four days after **setting out**, while the Titanic was sailing across the icy waters of the North Atlantic, a huge iceberg was suddenly spotted by a lookout. After the alarm had been given, the great ship turned **sharply** to avoid a direct collision. The Titanic turned just in time, **narrowly** missing the immense wall of ice which rose over 100 feet out of the water beside her. Suddenly, there was a **slight** **trembling** sound from below, and the captain went down to see what had happened. The noise had been so **faint** that no one thought that the ship had been damaged. Below, the captain realized to his **horror** that the Titanic was sinking rapidly, for five of her sixteen watertight compartments had already been flooded! The order to abandon ship was given and hundreds of people **plunged** into the icy water. As there were not enough lifeboats for everybody, 1, 500 lives were lost.

## Lesson 11 Not guilty 无罪


What was the Customs Officer looking for?



Customs Officers are quite tolerant these days, but they can still stop you when you are going through the Green Channel and have nothing to declare. Even really honest people are often made to feel guilty. The hardened professional smuggler, on the other hand, is never troubled by such feelings, even if he has five hundred gold watches hidden in his suitcase. When I returned from abroad recently, a particularly officious young Customs Officer clearly regarded me as a smuggler.

‘Have you anything to declare? ’ he asked, looking me in the eye.
‘No, ’ I answered confidently.
‘Would you mind unlocking （mind 后面一般加动名词）this suitcase please? ’
‘Not at all, ’ I answered.

The Officer went through the case with great care. All the things I had packed so carefully were soon in a dreadful mess. I felt sure I would never be able to close the case again. Suddenly, I saw the Officer's face light, up. He had spotted a tiny bottle at the bottom of my case and he pounced on it with delight.

‘Perfume, eh? ’ he asked sarcastically. ‘You should have declared that. Perfume is not exempt from import duty. ’
‘But it isn't perfume, ’ I said. ‘It's hair gel. ’ Then I added with a smile, ‘It's a strange mixture I make myself. ’
As I expected, he did not believe me.
‘Try it!’I said encouragingly.

The Officer unscrewed the cap and put the bottle to his nostrils. He was greeted by an unpleasant smell which convinced him that I was telling the truth. A few minutes later, I was able to hurry away with precious chalk marks on my baggage.

1 the Green Channel，绿色通道，指海关专供没有携带征税物品进关的旅客所走的通道。
2 hidden in his suitcase是过去分词短语作定语，修饰watches，它相当于一个定语从句：which were hidden in his suitcase.
3 looking me in the eye，直盯着我的眼睛，这是分词短语作状语，表示方式，修饰 asked。

4 The officer went through，这里go through作“检查”讲。
5 in a dreadful mess （或 in a mess），乱七八糟，混乱透了。
6 I saw the Officer's face light up．我看到那位官员的脸上露出了得意的神色。 在使用使役动词（如 "make"、"let"）或感官动词（如 "see"、"hear"、"watch"，看到你做了，那你已经做了，所以可以去掉to，to有将来的意思）时，后面的动词通常用原形。light up 是宾语补语



I saw the Officer's face lighting up表示一个时刻

I saw the Officer's face light up 表示过程



7 You should have declared that．你早该申报了。“should +不定式的完成式”表示本该做而未做之事。

## Lesson 12 Life on a desert island 荒岛生活


What was exceptional about the two men's stay on the desert island?

Most of us have formed an unrealistic picture of life on a desert island. We sometimes imagine a desert island to be a sort of paradise where the sun always shines. Life there is simple and good. Ripe fruit falls from the trees and you never have to work. **The other side of the picture is quite the opposite**. Life on a desert island is wretched. You either starve to death or live like Robinson Crusoe, waiting for a boat which never comes. Perhaps there is an element of truth in both these pictures, but few of us have had the opportunity to find out.

Two men who recently spent five days on a coral island wished they had stayed there longer. They were taking a badly damaged boat from the Virgin Islands to Miami to have it repaired. During the journey, their boat began to sink. They quickly loaded a small rubber dinghy with food, matches, and cans of beer and rowed for a few miles across the Caribbean until they arrived at a tiny coral island. There were hardly any trees on the island and there was no water, but this did not prove to be a problem. The men collected rainwater in the rubber dinghy. As they had brought a spear gun with them, they had plenty to eat. Theycaught lobster and fish every day, and, as one of them put it ‘ate like kings’. When a passing tanker rescued them five days later, both men were genuinely sorry that they had to leave.

## Lesson 13 It's only me 是我，别害怕

What did the man expect to find under the stairs?

After her husband had gone to work, Mrs. Richards sent her children to school and went upstairs to her bedroom. She was too excited to do any housework that morning, **for in the evening she would be going to** a fancy-dress party with her husband. She intended to dress up as a ghost and as she had made her costume the night before, she was impatient to try it on. Though the costume consisted only of a sheet, it was very effective. After putting it on, Mrs Richards went downstairs. She wanted to find out whether it would be comfortable to wear.

Just as Mrs. Richards was entering the dining room, there was a knock on the front door. She knew that it must be the baker. She had told him to come straight in if ever she failed to open the door and to leave the bread on the kitchen table. Not wanting to frighten the poor man, Mrs Richards quickly hid in the small storeroom under the stairs. She heard the front door open and heavy footsteps in the hall. Suddenly the door of the storeroom was opened and a man entered, Mrs Richards realized that it must be the man from the Electricity Board who had come to read the metre. She tried to explain the situation, saying‘It's only me’, but it was too late. The man let out a cry and jumped back **several paces**. When Mrs. Richards walked towards him, he fled, slamming the door behind him.

## Lesson 14: A noble **gangster **  贵族歹徒



How did Hawkwood make money in times of peace?

There was a time when the owners of shops and businesses in Chicago

had to pay large sums of money to gangsters in return for 'protection'.

If the money was not paid promptly,

the gangsters would quickly put a man out of business by destroying his shop.

Obtaining 'protection money' is not a modern crime.

As long ago as the fourteenth century,

an Englishman, Sir John Hawkwood,

made the remarkable discovery that people would rather pay large sums of money than have their life work destroyed by gangsters.





Six hundred years ago,

Sir John Hawkwood arrived in Italy with a band of soldiers and settled near Florence.

He soon made a name for himself and came to be known to the Italians as Giovanni Acuto.

Whenever the Italian city-states were at war with each other,

Hawkwood used to hire his soldiers to princes who were willing to pay the high price he demanded.

In times of peace, when business was bad,

Hawkwood and his men would march into a city-state,

and after burning down a few farms, would offer to go away if protection money was paid to them.

Hawkwood made large sums of money in this way.

In spite of this, the Italians regarded him as a sort of hero.

When he died at the age of eighty,

the Florentines gave him a state funeral and had a picture painted which was dedicated to the memory of 'the most valiant soldier and most notable leader, Signor Giovanni Haukodue'.

## Lesson 15 Fifty pence worth of trouble



Did George get anything for his fifty pence? What?

Children always appreciate small gifts of money.

Mum or dad, of course, provides a regular supply of pocket money,

but uncles and aunts are always a source of extra income.

With some children, small sums go a long way.

If fifty pence pieces are not exchanged for sweets,

they rattle for months inside money boxes.

Only very thrifty children manage to fill up a money box.

For most of them, fifty pence is a small price to pay for a nice big bar of chocolate.

My nephew, George, has a money box but it is always empty.

Very few of the fifty pence pieces and pound coins I have given him have found their way there.

I gave him fifty pence yesterday and advised him to save it.

Instead, he bought himself **fifty pence worth of trouble.**

On his way to the sweet shop,

he dropped his fifty pence and it bounced along the pavement and then disappeared down a drain.

George took off his jacket,

rolled up his sleeves and pushed his right arm through the drain cover.

He could not find his 50 pence piece anywhere, and what is more, he could not get his arm out.

A crowd of people gathered round him and a lady rubbed his arm with soap and butter,

but George was firmly stuck.

The fire brigade was called and two fire fighters **freed** George using a special type of grease.

George was not too upset by his experience,

because the lady who owns the sweet shop heard about his troubles and rewarded him with a large box of chocolates.

**Notes on the text课文注释**
1 with some children, 介词with此处作“对于”讲。
2 go a long way, 可以维持很久。
3 If fifty pence pieces are not exchanged for sweets, 如果50便士的分币没有用来换糖果的话。exchange…for…作“以……换……”讲，注意英语中的便士有两种复数形式pence和pennies, 但用法不同。如：a fifty pence是指1个50便士的硬币，而fifty pennies是指50个1便士的硬币。
4 **have found their way there,** 其中there是指储蓄罐。find one's way在这里作“进入”讲，即放到“储蓄罐”里。
5 what is more, 更有甚者。是固定词组，此处用作插入语。



small gifts of money/ gifts of money 零花钱



参考译文



孩子们总是喜欢得到一些零花钱。爸爸妈妈**当然**经常**给**孩子零花钱，但是，叔舅婶姨也是孩子们额外收入来源。**对于**有些孩子来说，**少量**的钱可以**花很长一段时间**。如果50便士不拿来换糖吃，则可以放在**储蓄罐里**叮当响上好几月。但是能把储蓄罐**装满**的只有**屈指可数**的几个特别节俭的孩子。对大部分孩子来说，用50便士来买一大块好的巧克力，是算不了什么的。

Children always appreciate **small gifts of money.**

Mum or dad, of course, provides a regular supply of pocket money,but uncles and aunts are always a source of extra income.

**With** some children, small sums **go a long way**.

If fifty pence pieces are not exchanged for sweets，they **rattle** for months inside **money boxes**.

Only very thrifty children manage to fill up a money box.For **most of them,** fifty pence is a small price to pay for a nice big bar of chocolate.











我的外甥乔治有一个储蓄罐，但总是空空的。我给了不少50便士的硬币，但没有几个存到储蓄罐里。昨天，我给了他50便士让**存**起来，却拿这钱给自己买了50便士的麻烦。在他去糖果店的路上，50便士掉在地上，在人行道上跳了几下，掉进了**阴沟**里。乔治脱掉**外套**，卷起袖子，将右胳膊**伸**进了**阴沟盖。**但他**摸了半天**也没找到那50便士硬币，**他的胳膊反倒退不出来了**。这时在他周围上了许多人，一位女士在乔治胳膊上**抹**了肥皂，黄油，但乔治的胳膊仍然卡得紧紧的。有人打电话叫来消防队，两位消防队员使用了一种特殊的**润滑剂**才使乔治得以解脱。不过，此事并没使乔治过于伤心，因为糖果店老板娘听说了他遇到的麻烦后，**赏**给他一大**盒**巧克力。

My nephew, George, has a money box but it is always empty.

**Very few of** the fifty pence pieces and pound coins I have given him have **found their way there.**

I gave him fifty pence yesterday and advised him to save it.

Instead, he bought himself fifty pence worth of trouble.

On his way to the sweet shop,he dropped his fifty pence and it **bounced** along the pavement and then disappeared **down a drain**.



George **took off** his jacket, rolled up his sleeves and pushed his right arm through the drain cover.

He could not find his 50 pence piece anywhere, **and what is more**, he could not get his arm out.



A crowd of people gathered round him and a lady rubbed his arm with soap and butter,but George was firmly stuck.

The **fire brigade** was called and two fire fighters **freed** George using a special type of **grease**.



George was not too upset by his experience，because the lady who owns the sweet shop heard about his troubles and rewarded him with a large **box** of chocolates.





## Lesson 16 Mary had a little lamb



Was Dimitri right to apologize to his neighbour? Why not?



Mary and her husband Dimitri lived in the tiny village of Perachora in southern Greece.

One of Mary's prize possessions was a little white lamb which her husband had given her.

She kept it tied to a tree in a field during the day and went to fetch it every evening.

One evening, however the lamb was missing.

The rope had been cut, so it was obvious that the lamb had been stolen.

When Dimitri came in from the fields, his wife told him what had happened.

Dimitri at once set out to find the thief.

He knew it would not prove difficult in such a small village.

After telling several of his friends about the theft,

Dimitri found out that his neighbour, Aleko, had suddenly acquired a new lamb.

Dimitri immediately went to Aleko's house and angrily accused him of stealing the lamb.

He told him he had better return it or he would call the police.

Aleko denied taking it and led Dimitri into his backyard.

It was true that he had just bought a lamb he explained,

but his lamb was black.

Ashamed of having acted so rashly, Dimitri apologized to Aleko for having accused him.

While they were talking it began to rain and Dimitri stayed in Aleko's house until the rain stopped.

When he went outside half an hour later,

he was astonished to find that the little black lamb was almost white.

Its wool, which had been dyed black,

had been washed clean by the rain!

had better用来表达一种建议，建议在将来某一具体场合采取的动作。这个短语比should和ought to的语气更强烈，常带有威胁、告诫或催促的意思。
4 denied taking it…,
deny后面可接动名词作宾语，也可接宾语从句。
5 apologize to sb. for (doing)sth. , 是“因（做）某事向某人道歉”的意思。

玛丽与丈夫迪米特里住在希腊南部一个叫波拉考拉的小村庄里。玛丽最珍贵的财产之一就是丈夫送给她的一只白色小羔羊。**白天**，玛丽把羔羊拴在地里的一颗树上，每天晚上把它牵回家。可是，一天晚上，那只小羔羊失踪了。绳子被人割断，很明显小羔羊是被人偷走了。

## Lesson 17 The longest suspension bridge in the world



The longest suspension bridge in the world

How is the bridge supported?

Verrazano, an Italian about whom little is known,sailed into New York Harbour in 1524 and named it Angouleme.

He described it as 'a very agreeable situation located within two small hills in the midst of which flowed a great river.'

Though Verrazano is by no means considered to be a great explorer, his name will probably remain immortal,for on November 21st, 1964, the longest suspension bridge in the world was named after him.

The Verrazano Bridge, which was designed by Othmar Ammann, joins Brooklyn to Staten Island.

It has a span of 4, 260 feet.

The bridge is so long that the shape of the earth **had to be taken into account** by its designer.

Two great towers support four huge cables.

The towers are built on immense underwater platforms made of steel and concrete.

The platforms extend to a depth of over 100 feet under the sea.

These alone took sixteen months to build.

Above the surface of the water, the towers rise to a height of nearly 700 feet.

They support the cables from which the bridge has been suspended.

Each of the four cables contains 26, 108 lengths of wire.

It has been estimated that if the bridge were packed with cars,

it would still only be carrying a third of its total capacity.

However, size and strength are not the only important things about this bridge.

Despite its immensity, it is both simple and elegant,

fulfilling its designer's dream to creat 'an enormous object drawn as faintly as possible'.

## Lesson 18  Electric currents in modern art  现代艺术的电流



How might some of the exhibits have been dangerous?



might  + have been  





Modern sculpture rarely surprises us any more.

The idea that modern art can only be seen in museums is **mistaken**.

**Even people who take no interest in art cannot have failed to notice examples of modern sculpture on display in public places.**

Strange forms stand in gardens, and outside buildings and shops.

We have got quite used to them.

Some **so-called** 'modern' pieces have been on display for nearly eighty years.







In spite of this, some people--including myself--were surprised by a recent exhibition of modern sculpture.

The first thing I saw when I entered the art gallery was a notice which said:

'Do not touch the exhibits, some of them are dangerous!'

The objects on display were pieces of moving sculpture.

**Oddly** shaped forms that are suspended from the ceiling

and move in response to a gust of wind are quite familiar to everybody.

These objects, however, were different.

Lined up against the wall, there were long thin wires attached to metal spheres.

The spheres had been magnetized and attracted or repelled each other all the time.

In the centre of the hall,

there were a number of tall structures which contained coloured lights.

These lights **flickered** continuously like traffic lights which have gone mad.

Sparks were emitted from small black boxes and red lamps flashed on and off angrily.

It was rather like an exhibition of **prehistoric** electronic equipment.

These **peculiar** forms not only seemed designed to shock people emotionally,

but to give them electric shocks as well!

## Lesson 19  A very dear cat



Why was Rastus 'very dear' in more ways than one?

Kidnappers are rarely interested in animals,but they recently took considerable interest in Mrs. Eleanor Ramsay's cat.

Mrs. Eleanor Ramsay, a very wealthy old lady,has shared a flat with her cat, Rastus, for a great many years.

Rastus leads an orderly life.

He usually takes a short walk in the evenings and is always home by seven o'clock.

One evening, however he failed to arrive.

Mrs. Ramsay got very worried.

She looked everywhere for him but could not find him.

Three days after Rastus' disappearance,

Mrs. Ramsay received an anonymous letter.

The writer stated that Rastus was **in safe hands** and would be returned immediately if Mrs. Ramsay paid a ransom of $1,000.

Mrs.Ramsay was instructed to place the money in a cardboard box and to leave it outside her door.

At first, she decided to go to the police,

but fearing that she would never see Rastus again--the letter had made that quite clear--she changed her mind.

She **withdrew** $1000 from her bank and followed the kidnapper's instructions.

The next morning, the box had disappeared but Mrs.Ramsay was sure that the kidnapper would keep his word.

Sure enough, Rastus arrived **punctually** at seven o'clock that evening.

He looked very well, though he was rather thirsty,for he drank half a bottle of milk.

The police were **astounded** when Mrs. Ramsay told them what she had done.

She explained that Rastus was very dear to her.

Considering the amount she paid,he was dear in more ways than one!

The writer stated that Rastus was in safe hands and would be returned immediately if Mrs. Ramsay paid a ransom of $1,000.

这句话没有虚拟语气，没有出现和事实相反的情况。

原句可能是：“If Mrs. Ramsay **pays** a ransom of $1,000, Rastus **will** be returned immediately.”

当主句的动词是过去时（如“stated”），条件从句中的时态通常需要相应地退一步。并且pays虽然是 一般现在时有将来的意思

## Lesson 20  Pioneer pilots



What was the name of the first plane to fly across the English Channel?



In 1908 Lord Northcliffe offered a prize of $1,000 to the first man who would fly across the English Channel.

Over a year passed before the first attempt was made.

On July 19th, 1909, in the early morning,Hubert Latham took off from the French coast in his plane the 'Antoinette IV.'

He had travelled only seven miles across the Channel when his engine failed and he was forced to land on the sea.

The 'Antoinette' floated on the water until Latham was picked up by a ship.

Two days later, Louis Bleriot arrived near Calais with a plane called 'No.XI'.

Bleriot had been making planes since 1905 and this was his latest model.

1908年，诺斯克利夫勋爵拿出1,000英镑，作为对第一个飞越英吉利**海峡**的人的奖励。然而**一年多**过去了才有人出来**尝试**。1909年7月19日凌晨，休伯特.莱瑟姆驾驶"安特瓦特4号"飞机从法国海岸起飞，但他只在海峡上空飞行7英里，**引擎就发生了故障**，他**只好**降落在海面上。"安特瓦特"号飞机在海上漂浮，**后来有船经过**，莱瑟姆方才获救。

 On July 19th, 1909, in the early morning, Hubert Latham took off from the French coast in his plane the 'Antoinette IV.

 He had travelled only seven miles across the Channel when his **engine failed** and he was forced to land on sea.

## Lesson 21 Daniel Mendoza



How many unsuccessful attempts did Mendoza make before becoming Champion of all England?



Boxing matches were very popular in England two hundred years ago.

In those days, boxers fought with bare **fists** for prize money.

Because of this, they were known as 'prizefighters'.

However, boxing was very crude,

for there were no rules and a prizefighter could be seriously injured or even killed during a match.







One of the most colourful figures in boxing history was Daniel Mendoza, who was born in 1764.

The use of gloves was not introduced until 1860,when the Marquis of Queensberry drew up the first set of rules.

Though he was technically a prizefighter,Mendoza did much to change crude prizefighting into a sport,for he brought science to the game.

In his day, Mendoza enjoyed tremendous popularity.

He was adored by rich and poor alike.





Mendoza rose to fame swiftly after a boxing match when he was only fourteen years old.

This attracted the attention of Richard Humphries who was then the most **eminent** boxer in England.

He offered to train Mendoza and his young pupil was quick to learn.

In fact, Mendoza soon became so successful that Humphries turned against him.

The two men quarrelled bitterly and it was clear that the argument could only **be settled** by a fight.

A match was held at Stilton,where both men fought for an hour.

The public bet a great deal of money on Mendoza, but he was defeated.

Mendoza met Humphries **in the ring** on a later occasion and he lost for a second time.

It was not until his third match in 1790 that he finally beat Humphries and became Champion of England.

Meanwhile, he founded a highly successful Academy and even Lord Byron became one of his pupils.

He earned enormous **sums** of money and was paid as much as $100 for a single appearance.

Despite this, he was so **extravagant** that he was always in debt.

After he was defeated by a boxer called Gentleman Jackson, he was quickly forgotten.

He was sent to prison for failing to pay his debts and died in poverty in 1836.

 在拳击比赛中

参考译文
  两百年前，拳击比赛在英国非常盛行。当时，拳击手们不戴手套，为争夺奖金而搏斗。因此，他们**被称作**“职业拳击手”。不过，拳击是十分野蛮的，因为当时没有任何比赛规则，职业拳击手有可能在比赛中受重伤，甚至丧命。
  拳击史上最引人注目的人物之一是丹尼尔.门多萨，他生于1764年。1860年昆斯伯里侯爵第一次为拳击比赛制定了规则，拳击比赛这才用上了手套。虽然门多萨严格来讲不过是个职业拳击手，但在把这种粗野的拳击变成一种体育运动方面，他作出了重大贡献。**是他把**科学引进了这项运动。门多萨在的全盛时期深受大家欢迎，无论是富人还是穷人都对他祟拜备至。

   门多萨在14岁时参加一场拳击赛后**一举成名。**这引起当时英国拳坛名将理查德.汉弗莱斯的注意。他主动提出教授门多萨，而年少的门多萨一学就会。**事实上**，门多萨不久便名声大振，致使汉弗莱斯与他**反目为敌**。两个人争吵不休**，显而易见**，只有较量一番才能解决问题。于是两人在斯蒂尔顿设下赛场，厮打了一个小时。公众把大笔赌注下到了门多萨身上，但他却输了。后来，门多萨与汉弗莱斯再次在拳击场上**较量**，门多萨又输了一场。直到1790年他们第3次对垒，门多萨才终于击败汉弗莱斯，成了全英拳击冠军。同时，他建立了一所拳击学校，办得很成功，连拜伦勋爵也成了他的学生。门多萨挣来大笔大笔的钱，一次出场费就多可达100英镑。尽管收入不少，但他挥霍无度，经常债台高筑。他在被一个叫杰克逊绅士的拳击手击败后很快被遗忘。他因**无力还债**而被捕入狱，最后于1836年在贫困中死去。

## Lesson 22 By heart



Which actor read the letter in the end, the aristocrat or the gaoler?



Some plays are so successful that they run for years on end.

In many ways, this is unfortunate for the poor actors who are required to go on repeating the same lines night after night.

One would expect them to know their parts by heart and never have cause to falter.

Yet this is not always the case.





A famous actor in a highly successful play was once cast in the role of an aristocrat who had been imprisoned in the Bastille for twenty years.

In the last act, a gaoler would always come on to the stage with a letter which he would hand to the prisoner.

Even though the noble was expected to read the letter at each performance,he always insisted that it should be written out in full.

One night, the gaoler decided to play a joke on his colleague to find out if,

after so many performances, he had managed to learn the contents of the letter by heart.

The curtain went up on the final act of the play and revealed the aristocrat sitting alone behind bars in his dark cell.

Just then, the gaoler appeared with the precious letter in his hands.

He entered the cell and presented the letter to the aristocrat.

But the copy he gave him had not been written out in full as usual.

It was simply a blank sheet of paper.

The gaoler **looked on** eagerly, anxious to see if his fellow actor had at last learnt his lines.

The noble stared at the blank sheet of paper for a few seconds.

Then, **squinting** his eyes, he said: 'The light is **dim**. Read the letter to me.'

And he promptly handed the sheet of paper to the gaoler.

Finding that he could not remember a word of the letter either,

the gaoler replied: 'The light is indeed dim, sire. I must get my glasses. '

With this, he hurried off the stage.

Much to the aristocrat's amusement,the gaoler returned a few moments later

with a pair of glasses and the usual copy of the letter which he **proceeded** to read to the prisoner.

有一位名演员曾在一出极为成功的剧目中扮演一个贵族角色，这个贵族已在巴士底狱被关押了20年。在最后一幕中，狱卒手持一封信上场，然后将信交给狱中那位贵族。尽管那个贵族每场戏都得念一遍那封信。但他还是坚持要求将信的全文写在信纸上。

## Lesson 23 One man's meat is another man's poison





What was it about snails that made the writer collect them for his friend on that day in particular?

People become quite illogical when they try to decide what can be eaten and what cannot be eaten.

If you lived in the Mediterranean, for instance, you would consider octopus a great delicacy.

You would not be able to understand why some people find it repulsive.

On the other hand,your stomach would turn at the idea of frying potatoes in animal fat-the normally accepted practice in many northern countries.

The sad truth is that most of us have been brought up to eat certain foods and we stick to them all our lives.



No creature has received more praise and abuse than the common garden snail.

Cooked in wine, snails are a great luxury in various parts of the world.

There are countless people who,ever since their early years, have learned to associate snails with food.

My friend, Robert, lives in a country where snails are **despised**.

As his flat is in a large town, he has no garden of his own.

For years he has been asking me to collect snails from my garden and take them to him.

The idea never appealed to me very much, but one day, after a heavy shower,

I happened to be walking in my garden when I noticed a huge number of snails taking a stroll on some of my prize plants.

Acting on a sudden impulse,I collected several dozen, put them in a paper bag, and took them to Robert.

Robert was delighted to see me and equally pleased with my little gift.

I left the bag in the hall and Robert and I went into the living room where we talked for a couple of hours.

I had forgotten all about the snails when Robert suddenly said that I must stay to dinner.

Snails would, of course, be the main dish.

I did not fancy the idea and I reluctantly followed Robert out of the room.

To our dismay,we saw that there were snails everywhere:

they had escaped from the paper bag and had taken complete possession of the hall!

 I have never be able to look at a snail since then

## Lesson 24 A skeleton in the cupboard



Who was Sebastian?



We often read in novels how a seemingly respectable person or family

has some terrible secret which has been concealed from strangers for years.

The English language possesses a vivid saying to describe this sort of situation.

The terrible secret is called 'a skeleton in the cupboard'.

At some dramatic moment in the story,

the terrible secret becomes known and a reputation is ruined.

The reader's hair stands on end when he reads in the final pages of the novel that the heroine,

a dear old lady who had always been so kind to everybody, had, in her youth, poisoned every one of her five husbands.

It is all very well for such things to occur in fiction.

To varying degrees,we all have secrets which we do not want even our closest friends to learn,

but few of us have skeletons in the cupboard.

The only person I know who has a skeleton in the cupboard is George Carlton, and he is very proud of the fact.

George studied medicine in his youth.

Instead of becoming a doctor, however, he became a successful writer of detective stories.

I once spent an uncomfortable weekend which I shall never forget at his house.

George showed me to the guestroom which, he said, was rarely used.

He told me to unpack my things and then come down to dinner.

After I had stacked my shirts and underclothes in two empty drawers,

I decided to hang one of the two suits I had brought with me in the cupboard.

I opened the cupboard door and then stood in front of it petrified.

A skeleton was dangling before my eyes.

The sudden movement of the door made it sway slightly and it gave me the impression that it was about to leap out at me.

Dropping my suit, I dashed downstairs to tell George.

This was worse than 'a terrible secret'; this was a real skeleton!

But George was unsympathetic.'Oh, that,' he said with a smile as if he were talking about an old friend.

'That's Sebastian.You forget that I was a medical student once upon a time.'

参考译文

  在小说中，我们经常读到一个表面上受人尊重的人物或家庭，却有着某种多年不为人所知的骇人听闻的秘密。英语中有一个生动的说法来形容这种情况。惊人的秘密称作“柜中骷髅”。在小说的某个戏剧性时刻，可怕的秘密泄漏出来，接着便是某人的声誉扫地。当读者到小说**最后几页**了解到书中女主人公，那位一向待大家很好的可爱的老妇人年轻时一连毒死了她的5个丈夫时，不禁会毛骨悚然。



We often read in novels how a seemingly respectable person or family has some terrible secret which has been concealed from strangers for years.

The English language possesses a vivid saying to describe this sort of situation.

The terrible secret is called 'a skeleton in the cupboard'.

At some dramatic moment in the story, the terrible secret becomes known and a reputation is ruined.

The reader's **hair stands on end** when he reads in the final pages of the novel **that** the heroine,a dear old lady who had always been so kind to everybody, had, in her youth, poisoned every one of her five 

husbands. 

 这种事发生在小说中**是无可非议的**。尽管我们人人都有各种大小秘密。连最亲密的朋友都不愿让他们知道， 但我们当中极少有人有柜中骷髅。我所认识的唯一的在柜中**藏**骷嵝的人便是乔治.卡尔顿，他甚至引以为自豪。乔治年轻时**学过医**，然而，他后来没当上医生，却成了一位成功的侦探小说作家。**有一次**，我在他家里度周末，过得很不愉快。这事我永远不会忘记。乔治把我**领**进客房，说这间很少使用。他让我打开行装后下楼吃饭。我将**衬衫**、内衣放进两个空抽屉里，然后我想把**随身带来的**两套西服中的一套挂到大**衣柜**里去。我打开柜门，站在柜门前一下惊呆了。一具骷髅悬挂在眼前，由于柜门突然打开，它也随之轻微摇晃起来，让我觉得它好像马上要跳出柜门朝我扑过来似的。我扔下西服冲下楼去告诉乔治。这是比“骇人听闻的秘密”更加惊人的东西，这是一具真正的骷髅啊！但乔治却无动于衷。“噢，是它呀！**他笑着说道**，俨然在谈论一位老朋友。“那是塞巴斯蒂安。你忘了我以前是学医的了。”



It is all **very well** for such things to occur in fiction.

To varying degrees,we all have secrets which we do not want even our closest friends to learn,

but few of us have skeletons in the cupboard.

The only person I know who has a skeleton in the cupboard is George Carlton, and he is very proud of the fact.

George studied medicine in his youth.

Instead of becoming a doctor, however, he became a successful writer of detective stories.

I **once** spent an uncomfortable weekend which I shall never forget at his house.

George showed me to the guestroom which, he said, was rarely used.

He told me to unpack my things and then come down to dinner.

After I had stacked my shirts and underclothes in two empty drawers,

I decided to hang one of the two suits I had **brought with me** in the cupboard.

I opened the cupboard door and then stood in front of it petrified.

A skeleton was **dangling** before my eyes.

The sudden movement of the door made it sway slightly and it gave me the impression that it was about to **leap** out at me.



Dropping my suit, I dashed downstairs to tell George.

This was worse than 'a terrible secret'; this was a real skeleton!

But George was unsympathetic. 'Oh, that,' he said with a smile as if he were talking about an old friend.

'That's Sebastian.

You forget that I was a medical student **once upon a time.'**







## Lesson 25 The Cutty Sark



What piece of bad luck prevented the Cutty Sark from winning the race?



One of the most famous sailing ships of the nineteenth century, the Cutty Sark, can still be seen at Greenwich.

She stands on dry land and is visited by thousands of people each year.

She **serves as an impressive reminder** of the great ships of the past.

Before they were replaced by steamships,sailing vessels like the Cutty Sark were used to carry tea from China and wool from Australia.

The Cutty Sark was one of the fastest sailing ships that has ever been built.

The only other ship to match her was the Thermopylae.

Both these ships set out from Shanghai on June 18th, 1872 on an exciting race to England.

This race, which went on for exactly four months, was the last of its kind.

It marked the end of the great tradition of ships with sails and the beginning of a new era.



The first of the two ships to reach Java after the race had begun was the Thermopylae,

but on the Indian Ocean, the Cutty Sark took the lead.

It seemed certain that she would be the first ship home,but during the race she had a lot of bad luck.

In August, she was struck by a very heavy storm during which her rudder was torn away.

The Cutty Sark rolled from side to side and it became impossible to steer her.

A temporary rudder was made on board from spare planks and it was fitted with great difficulty.

This greatly reduced the speed of the ship,for there was a danger that if she travelled too quickly,

this rudder would be torn away as well.

Because of this, the Cutty Sark lost her lead.

After crossing the Equator, the captain called in at a port to have a new rudder fitted,

but by now the Thermopylae was over five hundred miles ahead.

Though the new rudder was fitted at tremendous speed, it was impossible for the Cutty Sark to win.

She arrived in England a week after the Thermopylae.

Even this was remarkable, considering that she had had so many delays.

There is no doubt that if she had not lost her rudder she would have won the race easily.

## Lesson 26  Wanted: a large biscuit tin

[征购大饼干筒]

Who won the prize for the biggest biscuit?



No one can avoid being influenced by advertisements.

Much as we may pride ourselves on our good taste,we are no longer free to choose the things we want,

for advertising exerts a subtle influence on us.

In their efforts to persuade us to buy this or that product,advertisers have made a close study of human nature and have classified all our little weaknesses.

Advertisers discovered years ago that all of us love to get something for nothing.

An advertisement which begins with the magic word FREE can rarely go wrong.

These days, advertisers not only offer free samples,but free cars, free houses, and free trips round the world as well.

They devise hundreds of competitions which will enable us to win huge sums of money.

Radio and television have made it possible for advertisers to capture the attention of millions of people in this way.

During a radio programme,a company of biscuit manufacturers once asked listeners to bake biscuits and send them to their factory.

They offered to pay $10 a pound for the biggest biscuit baked by a listener.

The response to this competition was tremendous.

**Before long**, biscuits of all shapes and sizes began arriving at the factory.

One lady brought biscuit on a wheelbarrow.

It weighed nearly 500 pounds.

A little later, a man came along with a biscuit which occupied the whole boot of his car.

All the biscuits that were sent were carefully weighed.The largest was 713 pounds.

It seemed certain that this would win the prize.

But just before the competition closed,a lorry arrived at the factory with a truly colossal biscuit which weighed 2, 400 pounds.

It had been baked by a college student who had used over 1, 000 pounds of flour, 800 pounds of sugar,

200 pounds of fat, and 400 pounds of various other ingredients.

It was so heavy that a crane had to be used to remove it from the lorry.

The manufacturers had to pay more money than they had anticipated,for they bought the biscuit from the student for $24, 000.

## Lesson 27   Nothing to sell and nothing to buy





What is the most important thing for a tramp?

It has been said that everyone lives by selling something.

In the light of this statement, teachers live by selling knowledge,

philosophers by selling wisdom and priests by selling spiritual comfort.

Though it may be possible to measure the value of material goods in terms of money,

it is extremely difficult to estimate the true value of the services which people perform for us.

There are times when we would willingly give everything we possess to save our lives,

yet we might grudge paying a surgeon a high fee for offering us precisely this service.

The conditions of society are such that skills have to be paid for in the same way that goods are paid for at a shop.

Everyone has something to sell.

Tramps seem to be the only exception to this general rule.

Beggars almost sell themselves as human beings to arouse the pity of passers-by.

But real tramps are not beggars.

They have nothing to sell and require nothing from others.

In seeking independence, they do not sacrifice their human dignity.

A tramp may ask you for money,

but he will never ask you to feel sorry for him.

He has deliberately chosen to lead the life he leads and is fully aware of the consequences.

He may never be sure where the next meal is coming from,s

but he is free from the thousands of anxieties which afflict other people.

His few material possessions make it possible for him to move from place to place with ease.

By having to sleep in the open, he gets far closer to the world of nature than most of us ever do.

He may hunt, beg, or steal occasionally to keep himself alive;

he may even, in times of real need, do a little work; but he will never sacrifice his freedom.

We often speak of tramps with contempt and put them in the same class as beggars,

but how many of us can honestly say that we have not felt a little envious of their simple way of life and their freedom from care?

据说每个人都靠出售某种东西来维持生活。**根据这种说法**，教师靠卖知识为生，哲学家靠卖智慧为生，牧师靠卖精神安慰为生。虽然物质产品的价值可以用金钱来**衡量**，但要**估算**别人为我们为所提供的服务的价值却是极其困难的。有时，我们为了挽救生命，愿意付出我们所**占有**的一切。但就在外科大夫给我们提供了这种服务后，我们却可能为所支付的昂贵的费用而抱怨。社会上的情况就是如此，技术是必须付钱去买的，就像在商店里要花钱买商品一样。人人都有东西可以出售。

在这条普遍的规律前面，好像只有流浪汉是个例外，乞丐出售的几乎是他本人，以引起过路人的怜悯。但真正的流浪并不是乞丐。他们既不出售任何东西，也不需要从别人那儿得到任何东西，在追求独立自由的同时，他们并不牺牲为人的尊严。游浪汉可能会向你讨钱，但他从来不要你可怜他。他是故意在选择过那种生活的，**并完全清楚**以这种方式生活的后果。他可能从不知道下顿饭有无着落，但他不像有人那样被千万桩愁事所折磨。他几乎没有什么财产，这使他能够轻松自如地在各地奔波。由于被迫在露天睡觉，他比我们中许多人都离大自然近得多。为了生存，他可能会去打猎、乞讨，偶尔偷上一两回；确实需要的时候，他甚至可能干一点儿活，但他决不会牺牲自由。说起流浪汉，我们常常带有轻蔑并把他们与乞丐归为一类。但是，我们中有多少人能够坦率地说我们对流浪汉的简朴生活与无忧无虑的境况不感到有些羡慕呢？

## Lesson 28  Five pounds too dear



Why was even five pounds 'too dear' ?



Small boats loaded with wares sped to the great liner as she was entering the harbour.

Before she had anchored, the men from the boats had climbed on board

and the decks were soon covered with colourful rugs from Persia,

silks from India, copper coffee pots, and beautiful handmade silverware.

It was difficult not to be tempted.

Many of the tourists on board had begun bargaining with the tradesmen,

but I decided not to buy anything until I had disembarked.

I had no sooner got off the ship than I was assailed by a man who wanted to sell me a diamond ring.

I had no intention of buying one,

but I could not conceal the fact that I was impressed by the size of the diamonds.

Some of them were as big as marbles.

The man went to great lengths to prove that the diamonds were real.

As we were walking past a shop,

he held a diamond firmly against the window and made a deep impression in the glass.

It took me over half an hour to get rid of him.

The next man to approach me was selling expensive pens and watches.

I examined one of the pens closely.

It certainly looked genuine.

At the base of the gold cap, the words 'made in the U.S.A.' had been neatly inscribed.

The man said that the penwas worth $50,

but as a special favour, he would let me have it for $30.

I shook my head and held up five fingers indicating that I was willing to pay $5.

Gesticulating wildly, the man acted as if he found my offer outrageous

but he eventually reduced the price to 10 pounds.

Shrugging my shoulders I began to walk away when,

a moment later, he ran after me and thrust the pen into my hands.

Though he kept throwing up his arms in despair, he readily accepted the $5 I gave him.

I felt especially pleased with my wonderful bargain--until I got back to the ship.

No matter how hard I tried,it was impossible to fill this beautiful pen with ink and to this day it has never written a single word!

3 get rid of，摆脱。
4 as a special favour，作为一种特殊的优惠。
5 throw up his arms in despair，绝望地举起双手。







当一艘大型班船**进港**的时候，许多小船载着各种杂货快速向客轮驶来。大船还未下锚。小船上的人就纷纷爬上客轮。**一会儿工夫**，甲板上就摆满了色彩斑斓的波斯**地毯**。印度丝绸。铜咖啡壶以及手工制作的漂亮的银器。要想不为这些东西所动心是很困难的。船上许多游客开始同商贩讨价还价起来，但我打定主意上岸之前什么也不买。



Small boats loaded with ware sped to the great liner as she was **entering**  the **harbour**.

Before she had anchored, the men from the boats had climbed on board

and the decks were soon **covered with** colourful **rugs** from Persia,, indian **silk**, **copper** coffer pots and  handmade silverware.

It was difficult not to be **tempted**.

Many of the tourists on board had begun bargaining with the tradesmen,, but I decided not to buy anything until I had disembarked.



我刚下船，就被一个人截住，他向我兜售一枚钻石戒指。我根本不想买，但我不能掩饰这样一个事实：其钻石之大给我留下了深刻的印象。有的钻石像玻璃球**那么大**。那人**竭力**想证明那钻石是真货。我们**路过**一家商店时，他将一颗钻石使劲地往橱窗上一按，在玻璃上留下一道**深痕**。我花了半个多小时才摆脱了他的纠缠。

I had **no sooner** got off the ship **than** I was **assailed** by a man who wanted to sell me a diamond ring.

I had no intention of buying one,

but I could not conceal the fact that I was impressed by the size of the diamonds.

Some of them were as big as **marbles**.

The man **went to great lengths** **to prove** that the diamonds were real.

As we were **walking past** a shop,he **held** a diamond firmly against the window and **made a deep impression** in the glass.

It took me over half an hour to get rid of him.



向我兜售的第二个人是卖名贵钢笔和手表的。我仔细察看了一枝钢笔，那看上去确实不假，金笔帽下方整齐地刻有"美国制造"字样。那人说那支笔值50英镑，作为特别优惠，他愿意让我出30英镑成交。**我摇摇头**，伸出5根手指表示我只愿出5镑钱。那人激动地打着手势，仿佛我的出价使他不能容忍。但他终于把价钱降到了10英镑。我耸耸肩膀**掉头走开了**。一会儿，他突然从后**追了上来**，把笔塞到我手里。虽然他**绝望**地举起双手，但他毫不迟疑地收下了我付给他的5镑钱。在回到船上之前，我一直为我的绝妙的讨价还价而洋洋得意。然而不管我如何摆弄，那枝漂亮的钢笔就是吸不进墨水来。直到今天，那枝笔连一个字也没写过！





The next man to approach me was selling expensive pens and watches.

I examined one of the pens **closely**.

It certainly looked genuine.

At the **base** of the gold cap, the words 'made in the U.S.A.' had been **neatly inscribed.**

## Lesson 29 Funny or not?



What is the **basis** of 'sick' humour?

Whether we find a joke funny or not largely depends on where we have been brought up.

The sense of humour is **mysteriously** bound up with national **characteristics**.

A Frenchman, for instance, might find it hard to laugh at a Russian joke.

In the same way, a Russian might fail to see anything amusing in a joke which would make an Englishman laugh to tears.

Most funny stories are based on comic situations.

In spite of national differences, certain funny situations have a universal **appeal**.

No matter where you live,you would find it difficult not to laugh at, say, Charlie Chaplin's early films.

However, a new type of humour, which **stems** largely from U.S., has recently **come into fashion.**

It is called 'sick humour'.

Comedians **base** their jokes **on** tragic situations like violent death or serious accidents.

Many people find this sort of joke **distasteful**.

The following example of 'sick humour' will enable you to **judge for yourself.**

A man who had broken his right leg was taken to hospital a few weeks before Christmas.

From the moment he arrived there,

he kept on **pestering** his doctor to tell him when he would be able to go home.

He **dreaded** **having** to spend Christmas in hospital.

Though the doctor did his best, the patient's recovery was slow.

On Christmas day, the man still had his right leg in **plaster**.

He spent a **miserable** day in bed thinking of all the fun he was missing.

The following day, however, the doctor **consoled** him by telling him that his chances of being able to leave hospital in time for New Year celebrations were good.

The man **took heart** and **sure enough,**on New Year's Eve he was able to **hobble** along to a party.

To **compensate** for his unpleasant experiences in hospital,the man drank a little more than was good for him.

In the process, he enjoyed himself **thoroughly** and kept telling everybody how much he hated hospitals.

He was still **mumbling** something about hospitals at the end of the party when he **slipped** on a piece of ice and broke his left leg.

　　2 be bound up with，与……联系在一起。

　　3 you would find it difficult not to laugh at, say,Charlie Chaplin's early films. 比如说，你看了查理·卓别林的早期电影很难不发笑。句中的say是插入语，可译作“比如说”。查理·卓别林是电影史上最有名的演员之一。他在诸如《淘金记》(1924)这类电影中扮演的流浪汉“小人物”在各种不利的条件下仍获得了成功。

　　4 stem from，起源于。

　　5 come into fashion，

　　开始流行，时兴起来。

　　6 judge for yourself，你自己来判断。

　　7 **take heart**，振作精神。

　　8 the man drank a little more than was good for him.这个人稍微多喝了一点酒。

　　此句than后面省略了主语what， be good for sb. 是“对某人有益”的意思。

一些语法学家认为，than后面带what结构是累赘的表达，因此在比较正式的表达中，than后面的主语what经常省略。

## Lesson 30 The death of a ghost



Why did the two brothers keep the secret?



For years, villagers believed that Endley farm was **haunted**.

The farm was owned by two brothers, Joe and Bob Cox.

They employed a few farmhands, but no one was willing to work there long.

Every time a worker gave up his job, he told the same story.

Farm labourers said that they always woke up to find that work had been done overnight.

**Hay** had been cut and **cowsheds** had been cleaned.

A farm worker, who **stayed up all night,** claimed to have seen a figure cutting corn in the moonlight.

In time, it became an accepted fact that the Cox brothers employed a **conscientious** ghost that did most of their work for them.

No one suspected that there might be someone else on the farm who had never been seen.



This was indeed the case.

A short time ago, villagers were astonished to learn that the ghost of Endley had died.

Everyone went to the funeral, for the 'ghost' was none other than Eric Cox,a third brother who was supposed to have died as a young man.



After the funeral, Joe and Bob revealed a secret which they had kept for over fifty years.

Eric had been the eldest son of the family, very much older than his two brothers.

He had been **obliged to** join the army during the Second World War.

As he hated army life, he decided to **desert** his **regiment**.

When he learnt that he would be sent abroad,he returned to the farm and his father hid him until the end of the war.

Fearing the authorities, Eric remained in hiding after the war as well.

His father told everybody that Eric had been killed **in action.**

The only other people who knew the secret were Joe and Bob.

They did not even tell their wives.

When their father died they thought it their duty to keep Eric in hiding.

All these years, Eric had lived as a **recluse**.

He used to sleep during the day and work at night,quite unaware of the fact that he had become the ghost of Endley.

When he died, however, his brothers found it impossible to keep the secret any longer.

**多年来**，村民们一直认为恩得利农场在闹鬼。恩得利农场属于乔.考科斯和鲍勃.考科斯兄弟俩所有。他们雇了几个农工，但谁也不愿意在那儿长期工作下去。每次雇工辞职后都叙述着同样的故事。雇工们说，常常一早起来发现有人在夜里把活干了，干草已切好，牛棚也打扫干净了。有一个**彻夜未眠**的雇工还声称他看见一个人影在月光下**收割**庄稼**。随着时间的流逝**，考科斯兄弟雇了一个尽心尽责的鬼，他们家的活大部分都让鬼给干了，这件事成了公认的事实。

埃里克是这家长子。年龄比他两个弟弟大很多，第二次世界大战期间被迫参军。他讨厌军旅生活，决定逃离所在部队。当他了解自己将被派遣出国时，他**逃回**农场，父亲把他藏了起来，直到战争结束。由于害怕当局，埃里克战后继续深藏不露。他的父亲告诉大家，埃里克在战争中被打死了。除此之外，**只有**乔与鲍知道这个秘密。但他俩连自己的妻子都没告诉。父亲死后，他们兄弟俩认为有责任继续把埃里克藏起来。这些年来，埃里克过着隐士生活，白天睡觉，夜里出来干活，**一点不知道**自己已成了恩得利家场的活鬼。他死后，他的弟弟们才觉得无法再保守这个秘密了。

## Lesson 31 A lovable eccentric



True **eccentrics** never deliberately **set out** to draw attention to themselves.

They **disregard** social **conventions** without being **conscious** that they are doing anything extraordinary.

This **invariably** wins them the love and respect of others,

for they add colour to the **dull(monotonous )** routine of everyday life.

**Up to the time of** his death,Richard Colson was one of the most notable figures in our town.

He was a **shrewd** and wealthy businessman,

but most people in the town hardly knew anything about this side of his life.

He was known to us all as Dickie and his eccentricity had become legendary long before he died.

Dickie disliked **snobs** **intensely**.

Though he owned a large car, he hardly ever used it, **preferring** always to go on foot.

Even when it was raining heavily, he refused to carry an umbrella.

One day, he walked into an expensive shop after having been caught in a particularly heavy shower.

He wanted to buy a $300 watch for his wife,

but he was in such a **bedraggled** condition that an assistant refused to serve him.

Dickie left the shop without a word and returned carrying a large cloth bag.

As it was extremely heavy, he dumped it on the counter.

The assistant asked him to leave,

but Dickie paid no attention to him and requested to see the manager.

Recognizing who the customer was,the manager was most apologetic and **reprimanded** the assistant severely.

When Dickie was given the watch, he presented the assistant with the cloth bag.

It contained $300 in pennies.

He insisted on the assistant's counting the money before he left--30, 000 pennies in all!

On another occasion, he invited a number of important critics to see his private collection of modern paintings.

This exhibition received a great deal of attention **in the press,**

for though the pictures were supposed to be the work of famous artists,

they had in fact been painted by Dickie.

It took him four years to stage this **elaborate** joke simply to prove that **critics** do not always know what they are talking about.

  真正古怪的人从不有意引人注意。他们不顾社会习俗，意识不到自己所作所为有什么特殊之处。他们总能赢得别人的喜爱与尊敬，因为他们给平淡单一的日常生活增添了色彩。
  理查德.科尔森生前是我们镇上最有名望的人之一。他是个精明能干、有钱的商人，但镇上大部分人对他生活中的这一个方面几乎一无所知。大家都管他叫迪基。早在他去世前很久，他的古怪行为就成了传奇故事了。
  迪基痛恨势利小人。尽管他有一辆豪华小轿车，但却很少使用，常常喜欢以步代车。即使大雨倾盆，他也总是拒绝带伞。一天，他遇上一场瓢泼大雨，淋得透湿。他走进一家高级商店，要为妻子买一块价值300英镑的手表。但店员见他浑身泥水的样子，竟不肯接待他。迪基二话没说就走了。一会儿，他带着一个大布口袋回到店里。布袋很沉，他重重地把布袋扔在柜台上。店员让迪基走开，他置之不理，并要求见经理。经理认出了这位顾客，表示了深深的歉意，还严厉地训斥了店员。店员为迪基拿出了那块手表，迪基把布口袋递给他，口袋里面装着300镑的便士。他坚持要店员点清那些硬币后他才离去。

还有一次，他邀请一些著名评论家来参观他私人收藏的现代画。这次展览引起报界广泛注意，因为这些画名义上是名家的作品，事实上是迪基自己画的。他花了4年时间策划这出精心设计的闹剧，只是想证明评论家们有时并不解他们所谈论的事情。

Dickie left the shop without a word and returned carrying a large cloth bag.

As it was extremely heavy, he dumped it on the counter.

The assistant asked him to leave,but Dickie **paid no attention** to him and requested to **see the manager.**

Recognizing who the customer was,

the manager was most apologetic and **reprimanded** the assistant severely.

When Dickie was given the watch, he **presented** the assistant **with** the cloth bag.

It contained $300 in pennies.

He insisted on the assistant's counting the money before he left--30, 000 pennies in all!







还有一次，他邀请一些著名评论家来**参观**他私人收藏的现代画。这次展览**引起报界广泛注意**，因为这些画**名义上**是**名家**的作品，事实上是迪基自己画的。他花了4年时间策划这出精心设计的**闹剧**，只是想证明评论家们有时并不解他们所谈论的事情。

On another occasion, he invited a number of important critics to **see** his private collection of modern paintings.



This exhibition **received a great deal of attention** in the press,



for though the pictures **were supposed to be** the work of famous artists  ,they had in fact been painted by Dickie.

It took him four years to stage this **elaborate joke** simply to prove that critics do not always know what they are talking about.



## Lesson 32 A lost ship



Did the crew of the Elkor find what they were looking for? Why?



The salvage operation had been a complete failure.



The small ship, Elkor, which had been searching the Barents Sea **for weeks**, was on its way home.

A radio message from the mainland had been received by the ship's captain instructing him to give up the search.

The captain knew that another attempt would be made later,

for the **sunken** ship he was trying to find had been carrying a precious **cargo** of gold bullion.

Despite the message, the captain of the Elkor decided to try once more.

The sea bed was scoured with powerful nets and there was tremendous excitement on board when a chest was raised from the bottom.

Though the crew were at first **under the impression** that the lost ship had been found,

the contents of the chest proved them wrong.

What they had in fact found was a ship which had been sunk many years before.

The chest contained the personal belongings of a seaman, Alan Fielding.

There were books, clothing and photographs, together with letters which the seaman had once received from his wife.

The captain of the Elkor ordered his men to **salvage** as much as possible from the **wreck**.

Nothing of value was found,

but the numerous items which were brought to the surface proved to be of great interest.

From a heavy gun that was raised,the captain realized that the ship must have been a **cruiser**.

In another chest which contained the **belongings** of a ship's officer,there was an unfinished letter which had been written on March 14th, 1943.

The captain learnt from the letter that the name of the lost ship was the Karen.

The most valuable find of all was the ship's log book, parts of which it was still possible to read.

**From this** the captain was able to **piece** together all the information **that had come to light.**

The Karen had been sailing in a **convoy** to Russia when she was **torpedoed** by an enemy submarine.

This was later confirmed by a naval official at the Ministry of Defence after the Elkor had returned home.

All the items that were found were sent to the War Museum.

打捞工作彻底失败了。小船"埃尔科"号在巴伦支海搜寻了几个星期之后，正在返航途中。返航前，该船船长收到了大陆发来的电报，指示他们放弃这次搜寻。船长知道日后还会再作尝试，因为他试图寻找的沉船上载有一批珍贵的金条。

48

尽管船长接了电报，他还是决定再试一试。他们用结实的网把海床搜索了一遍。当一只箱子从海底被打捞上来时，甲板上人们激动不已。船员们**开始认为**沉船找着了，但海底沉箱内的物品证明他们弄错了。事实上，他们发现的是另一艘沉没多年的船。

木箱内装有水手艾伦.菲尔丁的私人财物，其中有书箱、衣服、照片以及水手收到的妻子的来信。"埃尔科"号船长命令船员们尽量从沉船中打捞物品，但没发现什么值钱的东西，不过打捞出来的众多的物品还是引起了大家极大的兴趣。从捞起的一门大炮来看，船长认为那艘船一定是艘巡洋舰。另一只海底沉箱中装的是船上一位军官的财物，其中有一封写于1943年3月14日的信，但没有写完。从这封信中船长了解到沉船船名是"卡伦"号。打捞到的东西中最有价值的是船上的航海日志，其中有一部分仍然清晰可读。据此，船长可以将所有的那些已经搞清的材料拼凑起来。"卡伦"号当年在为其他船只护航驶往俄国的途中突然遭到敌方潜水艇鱼雷的袭击。这一说法在"埃尔科"号返航后得到的国防部一位海军官员的证实。那次打捞到的所有物品均被送往军事博物馆。





## Lesson 33 A day to remember



What **incident** began the series of traffic accidents?



We have all experienced days when everything goes wrong.

A day may begin well enough, but suddenly everything seems to get out of control.

What invariably happens is that a great number of things choose to go wrong at precisely the same moment.

It is as if a single unimportant event **set up** a chain of reactions.

Let us suppose that you are preparing a meal and keeping an eye on the baby at the same time.

The telephone rings and this marks the **prelude** to an **unforeseen** series of **catastrophes**.

While you are on the phone, the baby pulls the tablecloth off the table,

smashing half your best crockery and cutting himself in the process.

You hang up hurriedly and attend to baby, **crockery**, etc.

Meanwhile, the meal gets **burnt**.

As if this were not enough to reduce you to tears, your husband arrives, unexpectedly bringing three guests to dinner.

Things can go wrong on a big scale as a number of people recently discovered in Parramatta, a **suburb** of Sydney.

During the rush hour one evening two cars **collided** and both drivers began to argue.

The woman immediately behind the two cars happened to be a learner.

She suddenly got into a panic and stopped her car.

This made the driver following her **brake** hard.

His wife was sitting beside him holding a large cake.

As she was thrown forward,the cake **went right** through the **windscreen** and landed on the road.



Seeing a cake flying through the air, lorry driver who was **drawing up** alongside the car, pulled up all of a sudden.

The lorry was loaded with empty beer bottles and hundreds of them **slid off** the back of the vehicle and on to the road.

This led to yet another angry argument. Meanwhile, the traffic piled up behind.

It took the police nearly an hour to get the traffic on the move again.

In the meantime, the lorry driver had to sweep up hundreds of broken bottles.

Only two **stray** **dogs** benefited from all this **confusion**,

for they greedily **devoured** what was left of the cake.

It was just one of those days!

我们大家都有过事事不顺心的日子。一天开始时，可能还不错，但突然间似乎一切都失去了控制。情况经常是这样的，许许多多的事情都偏偏赶在同一时刻出问题，好像是一件无关紧要的小事引起了一连串的连锁反应。假设你在做饭，同时又在照看孩子。这时电话铃响了。**它预示着一连串意想不到的灾难的来临。**就在你接电话时，孩子把桌布从桌子上扯下来，将家中最好的陶瓷餐具半数摔碎，同时也弄伤了他自己。你急急忙忙挂上电话，赶去照看孩子和餐具。这时，饭又烧糊了。好像这一切还不足以使你急得掉泪，你的丈夫接着回来了，事先没打招呼就带来3个客人吃饭。

就像许多人最近在悉尼郊区帕拉马塔发现的那样，有时乱子会闹得很大。一天傍晚交通最拥挤时，一辆汽车撞上前面一辆汽车，两个司机争吵起来。紧跟其后的一辆车上的司机碰巧是个初学者，她一惊之下突然把车停了下来。她这一停使得跟在后头的司机也来个急刹车。司机妻子正坐在他身边，手里托着块大蛋糕。她往前一冲，蛋糕从挡风玻璃飞了出去掉到马路上。此时，一辆卡车正好从后边开到那辆汽车边上，司机看见一块蛋糕从天而降，紧急刹车。卡车上装着空啤酒瓶。成百只瓶子顺势从卡车后面滑出车外落在马路上。这又引起一场唇枪舌剑的争吵。与此同时，后面的车辆排成了长龙，警察花了将近一个小时才使车辆又开起来。在这段时间里，卡车司机不得不清扫那几百只破瓶子。只有两只野狗从这一片混乱中得到好处，它们贪婪地吃掉了剩下的蛋糕。这就是事事不顺心的那么一天！









## Lesson 34 A happy discovery





Antique shops exert a peculiar fascination on a great many people.

The more expensive kind of antique shop where rare objects are beautifully displayed in glass cases

to keep them free from dust is usually a forbidding place.

But no one has to **muster up** **courage** to enter a less **pretentious** antique shop.

There is always hope that in its **labyrinth** of **musty**, dark, **disordered** rooms a real rarity will be found amongst the piles of **assorted** junk that litter the floors.

No one discovers a rarity by chance.

A truly **dedicated** bargain hunter must have patience,

and above all, the ability to recognize the worth of something when he sees it.

To do this, he must be at least as knowledgeable as the dealer.

Like a scientist **bent on** making a discovery,

he must cherish the hope that one day he will be **amply** rewarded.

My old friend, Frank Halliday, is just such a person.

He has often described to me how he **picked up** a masterpiece for a mere $50.

One Saturday morning, Frank visited an antique shop in my neighbourhood.

As he had never been there before, he found a great deal to **interest** him.

The morning passed rapidly and Frank was about to leave when he noticed a large packing case lying on the floor.

The dealer told him that it had just come in,

but that he could not be bothered to open it.

Frank begged him to do so and the dealer reluctantly prised it open.

The contents were disappointing.

Apart from an interesting-looking carved dagger,

the box was full of crockery, much of it broken.

Frank gently lifted the crockery out of the box and suddenly noticed a miniature painting at the bottom of the packing case.

As its composition and line reminded him of an Italian painting he knew well, he decided to buy it.

Glancing at it briefly the dealer told him that it was worth $50.

Frank could hardly conceal his excitement,

for he knew that he had made a real discovery.

The tiny painting proved to be an unknown masterpiece

by Correggio and was worth hundreds and thousands of pounds.

古玩店对许多人来说有一种特殊的魅力。高档一点的古玩店为了防尘，把文物漂亮地陈列在玻璃柜子里，那里往往令人望而却步。而对不太装腔作势的古玩店，无论是谁都不用**壮着胆子**才敢往里进。人们还常常有希望在发霉、阴暗、杂乱无章、迷宫般的店堂里，从杂乱地摆放在地面上的、一堆堆各式各样的破烂货里找到一件稀世珍品。

56

无论是谁都不会一下子就发现一件珍品。一个到处找便宜的人必须具有耐心，而且最重要的是看到珍品时要有鉴别珍品的能力。要做到这一点，他至少要像古董商一样懂行。他必须像一个**专心致志**进行探索的科学家那样抱有这样的希望，即终有一天，他的努力会取得丰硕的成果。

57

我的老朋友弗兰克.哈利戴正是这样一个人。他多次向我详细讲他如何只花50英镑便买到一位名家的杰作。一个星期六的上午，弗兰克去了我家附近的一家古玩店。由于他从未去过那儿，结果他发现许多有趣的东西。上午很快过去了，弗兰克正准备离去，突然看见地板上放着一只体积很大的货箱。古董商告诉他那只货箱刚到不久，但他嫌麻烦不想把它打开。经弗兰克恳求，古董商才勉强把货箱撬开了。箱内东西令人失望。除了一柄式样别致、雕有花纹的匕首外，货箱内装满陶器，而且大部分都已破碎裂。弗兰克轻轻地把陶器拿出箱子，突然发现在箱底有一幅微型画，画面构图与纸条使他想起一幅他所熟悉的意大利画，于是他决定将画买了下来。古董商漫不经心看了一眼那幅画，告诉弗兰克那画值50英镑。弗兰克几乎无法掩饰自己兴奋的心情，因为他明白自己发现了一件珍品。那幅不大的画原来是柯勒乔的一幅未被发现的杰作，价值几十万英镑。



## Lesson 35 Justice was done

The word 'justice' is given two different meanings in the text.

What is the **distinction** between them?

The word justice is usually **associated** with courts of law.

We might say that justice has been done when a man's innocence or guilt has been proved **beyond doubt.**

Justice is part of the complex **machinery** of the law.

Those who seek it, undertake an **arduous** journey and can never be sure that they will find it.

Judges, however wise or eminent, are human and can make mistakes.

There are rare instances when justice almost **ceases** to be an abstract concept.

Reward or punishment are **meted out** quite independent of human interference.

**At such times**, justice acts like a living force.

When we use a phrase like **'it serves him right',**

we are, in part, admitting that a certain set of circumstances has enabled justice to act **of its** **own accord.**

When a thief was caught on the **premises** of a large jewellery store one morning,

the shop assistants must have found it impossible to **resist the temptation** to say 'it serves him right'.

The shop was an old converted house with many large, disused fireplaces and tall, narrow **chimneys**.

**Towards midday**, a girl heard a **muffled** cry coming from behind one of the walls.

As the cry was repeated several times,she ran to tell the manager who promptly rang up the fire brigade.

The cry had certainly come from one of the **chimneys**,but as there were so many of them, the firemen could not be certain which one it was.

They located the right chimney by tapping at the walls and listening for the man's cries.

After **chipping** **through** a wall which was eighteen inches thick,they found that a man had been trapped in the chimney.

As it was extremely narrow, the man was unable to move,

but the fire fighters were eventually able to free him by cutting a huge hole in the wall.

The sorry-looking, blackened figure that emerged,

admitted at once that he had tried to break into the shop during the night but had got stuck in the chimney.

He had been there for nearly ten hours.

Justice had been done even before the man **was handed over** to the police.

47

"正义"这个词常常是同法庭连在一起的。当某人被证据确凿地证明无罪的时候，我们也许会说正义得到了伸张。正义是复杂的法律机器组成部分。那些寻求正义的人走的是一条崎岖的道路，从来没有把握他们最终将到正义。法官无论如何聪明与有名，毕竟也是人，也会出差错的。

48

在个别情况下，正义不再是一种抽象概念。奖惩的实施是不受人意志支配的。在这种时候，正义像一种有生命的力量行使其职能。当我们说"他罪有应得"这句话的时候，我们部分承认了某种特定的环境使得正义自动地起了作用。

49

一天上午，当一个小偷在一家大型珠宝店里被人抓住的时候，店员一定会忍不住说："他罪有应得。"那是一座老式的、经过改造的房子，店里有许多废置不用的大壁炉和又高又窄的烟囱。快到中午的时候，一个女售货员听见从一堵墙里传出一种闷声闷气的叫声。由于这种喊叫声重复了几次，她跑去报告经理，经理当即给消防队挂了电话。喊叫声肯定是从烟囱里传出来的，然而，因为烟囱太多，消防队员无法确定到底是哪一个。他们通过叫击烟囱倾叫声而确定传出声音的那个烟囱。他们凿透了18英寸厚的墙壁，发现有个人卡在烟囱里。由于烟囱太窄，那人无法动弹。消防队员在墙上挖了个大洞，才终于把他解救出来。那个看来满脸沮丧、浑身漆黑的家伙从烟囱里一出来，就承认头天夜里他企图到店里行窍，但让烟囱卡住了。他已经在烟囱里被困了将近10个小时。甚至在那人还没被送交给警察之前，正义就已得到了伸张。





## Lesson 36 A chance in a million

What was the chance in a million?

We are less credulous than we used to be.

In the nineteenth century, a novelist would bring his story to a conclusion



by presenting his readers with a series of coincidences--most of them wildly improbable.

7

Readers happily accepted the fact that an obscure maidservant was really the hero's mother.

8

A long-lost brother, who was presumed dead, was really alive all the time

9

and wickedly plotting to **bring about the hero's downfall**. And so on.

10

Modern readers would find such naive solutions totally unacceptable.

11

Yet, in real life, circumstances do sometimes conspire to bring about coincidences

12

which anyone but a nineteenth century novelist would find incredible.

13

When I was a boy, my grandfather told me how a German taxi driver, Franz Bussman,

14

found a brother who was thought to have been killed twenty years before.

15

While on a walking tour with his wife, he stopped to talk to a workman.

16

After they **had gone on,**

17

Mrs. Bussman commented on the workman's close resemblance to her husband

18

and even suggested that he might be his brother.

19

Franz **poured scorn** on the idea,

20

pointing out that his brother had been killed in action during the war.

21

Though Mrs. Bussman was fully acquainted with this story,

22

she thought that there was a chance in a million that she might be right.

23

A few days later, she sent a boy to the workman to ask him if his name was Hans Bussman.

24

Needless to say, the man's name was Hans Bussman and he really was Franz's long-lost brother.

25

When the brothers were reunited,

26

Hans explained how it was that he was still alive.

27

After having been wounded **towards the end of the war,**

28

he had been sent to hospital and was separated from his unit.

29

The hospital had been bombed and Hans had made his way back into Western Germany on foot.

30

Meanwhile, his unit was lost and all records of him had been destroyed.

31

Hans returned to his family home,

32

but the house had been bombed

33

and no one in the neighbourhood knew what had become of the inhabitants.

34

Assuming that his family had been killed during an air raid,

35

Hans settled down in a village fifty miles away where he had remained ever since.

我们不再像以往那样轻易相信别人了。在19世纪，小说家常在小说结尾处给读者准备一系列的巧合--大部分是牵强附会，极不可能的。当时的读者却愉快地接受这样一些事实，一个低贱的女佣实际上是主人公的母亲；主人公一位长期失散的兄弟，大家都以为死了，实际上一直活着，并且正在策划暗算主人公；如此等等，现代读者会觉得这种天真的结局完全无法接受。不过，在现实生活中，有时确实会出现一些巧合，这些巧合除了19世纪小说家外谁也不会相信。

当我是个孩子的时候，我祖父给我讲了一位德国出租汽车司机弗朗兹。巴斯曼如何找到了据信已在20年前死去的兄弟的事。一次，他与妻子徒步旅行。途中，停下来与一个工人交谈，接着他们继续往前走去。巴斯曼夫人说那工人与她丈夫相貌很像，甚至猜测他可能就是她丈夫的兄弟。弗朗兹对此不屑一顾，指出他兄弟已经在战争中阵亡了。尽管巴斯曼夫人熟知这个情况，但她仍然认为自己的想法仍有百万分之一的可能性。几天后，她派了一个男孩去问那人是否叫汉斯.巴斯曼。不出巴斯曼夫人所料，那人的名字真是汉斯.巴斯曼，他确实是弗朗兹失散多年的兄弟。兄弟俩团聚之时，汉斯说明了他活下来的经过，战争即将结束时，他负伤被送进医院，并与部队失去联系。医院遭到轰炸，汉斯步行回到了西德。与此同时，他所在部队被击溃，他的所有档案材料全部毁于战火。汉斯重返故里，但他的家已被炸毁，左邻右舍谁也不知原住户的下落，汉斯以为全家人都在空袭中遇难，于是便在距此50英里外的一座村子里定居下来，直至当日。



## Lesson 37 The Westhaven Express



What was the mistake the author made?

We have learnt to expect that trains will be punctual.

After years of conditioning,

most of us have developed an unshakable faith in railway timetables.

Ships may be delayed by storms;

flights may be cancelled because of bad weather;

but trains must be on time.

Only an exceptionally heavy snow fall might temporarily **dislocate** railway services.

It is all too easy to blame the railway authorities when something does go wrong.

The truth is that when mistakes occur,they are more likely to be ours than theirs.

After consulting my railway timetable,

I noted with satisfaction that there was an express train to Westhaven.

It went direct from my local station and the journey lasted a mere hour and seventeen minutes.

When I boarded the train,

I could not help noticing that a great many local people got on as well.

At the time, this did not **strike me as odd.**

I reflected that there must be a great many people besides myself who wished to take advantage of this excellent service.

Neither was I surprised when the train stopped at Widley,

a tiny station a few miles along the line.

Even a mighty express train can be held up by signals.

But when the train dawdled at station after station, I began to wonder.

It suddenly dawned on me that this express was not roaring down the line at ninety miles an hour,

but barely chugging along at thirty.

One hour and seventeen minutes passed and we had not even covered half the distance.

I asked a passenger if this was the Westhaven Express,

but he had not even heard of it.

I determined to lodge a complaint as soon as we arrived.

Two hours later, I was talking angrily to the station master at Westhaven.

When he denied the train's existence, I borrowed his copy of the timetable.

There was a note of triumph in my voice when I told him that it was there in black and white.

Glancing at it briefly, he told me to look again.

A tiny asterisk conducted me to a footnote at the bottom of the page.

It said: 'This service has been suspended.'

参考译文

53

我们已经习惯于相信火车总是准点的。经过多年的适应，大多数人对火车时刻表产生了一种不可动摇的信念。轮船船期可能因风暴而推延，飞机航班可能因恶劣天气而取消，唯有火车必然是准点的。只有非同寻常的大雪才可能暂时打乱铁路运行。因此，一旦铁路上真出了问题，人们便不加思索地责备铁路当局。事实上，差错很可能是我们自己，而不是铁路当局的。

54

我查看了列车时刻表，满意地了解到有一趟去威斯特海温的快车。这是趟直达车，旅途总共才需1小时17分钟。上车后，我不禁注意到许多当地人也上了车。一开始，我并不感到奇怪，我想除我之外，想利用快车之便的也一定大有人在。火车开出几英里即在一个小站威德里停了下来。对此，我不觉得奇怪，因为即便是特别快车也可能被信号拦住。但是，当火车一站接着一站往前蠕动时，我便产生了怀疑。我突然感到这趟快车并没以时速90英里的速度呼啸前进，而是卟哧卟哧地向前爬行，时速仅30英里。1小时17分过去了，走了还不到一半路程。我问一位乘客，这是不是开往威斯特海温的那趟快车，他说从未听说过有这么一趟快车。我决定到目的地就给铁路部门提意见。两小时后，我气呼呼地同威斯特海温站站长说起此事。他说根本没有这趟车。于是我借他本人的列车时刻表，我带着一种胜利者的调子告诉他那趟车白纸黑字。明明白白印在时刻表上。他迅速地扫视了一眼，让我再看一遍。一个小小的星形符号把我的目光引到了那页底部一个说明上。上面写着："此趟列车暂停运行。"







## Lesson 38  The first calendar

3

What is the importance of the dots, lines, and symbols engraved on stone, bones and ivory?

4

Future historians will be in a unique position when they come to record the history of our own times.

5

They will hardly know which facts to select from the great mass of evidence that steadily accumulates.

6

What is more, they will not have to rely solely on the written word.

7

Films, videos, CDs and CD-ROMs are just some of the bewildering amount of information they will have.

8

They will be able, as it were, to see and hear us in action.

9

But the historian attempting to reconstruct the distant past is always faced with a difficult task.

10

He has to deduce what he can from the few scanty clues available.

11

Even seemingly insignificant remains can shed interesting light on the history of early man.

12

Up to now, historians have assumed that calendars came into being with the advent of agriculture,

13

for then man was faced with a real need to understand something about the seasons.

14

Recent scientific evidence seems to indicate that this assumption is incorrect.

15

Historians have long been puzzled by dots,

16

lines and symbols which have been engraved on walls, bones, and the ivory tusks of mammoths.

17

The nomads who made these markings lived by hunting and fishing during the last Ice Age

18

which began about 35, 000 B.C. and ended about 10, 000 B.C.

19

By correlating markings made in various parts of the world,

20

historians have been able to read this difficult code.

21

They have found that it is connected with the passage of days and the phases of the moon.

22

It is, in fact, a primitive type of calendar.

23

It has long been known that the hunting scenes depicted on walls were not simply a form of artistic expression.

24

They had a definite meaning, for they were as near as early man could get to writing.

25

It is possible that there is a definite relation between these paintings and the markings that sometimes accompany them.

26

It seems that man was making a real effort to understand the seasons 20, 000 years earlier than has been supposed.

参考译文

63

未来的历史学家在写我们这一段历史的时候会别具一格。对于逐渐积累起来的庞大材料，他们几乎不知道选取哪些好，而且，也不必完全依赖文字材料。电影、录像、光盘和光盘驱动器只是能为他们提供令人眼花缭乱的大量信息的几种手段。他们能够身临其境般地观看我们做事，倾听我们讲话。但是，历史学家企图重现遥远的过去可是一项艰巨的任务，他们必须根据现有的不充分的线索进行推理。即使看起来微不足道的遗物，也可能揭示人类早期历史的一些有趣的内容。

64

历史学家迄今认为日历是随农业的问世而出现的，因为当时人们面临着了解四季的实际需要，但近期科学研究发现，好像这种假设是不正确的。

65

长期以来，历史学家一直对雕刻在墙壁上、骨头上、古代长毛象的象牙上的点、线和形形色色的符号感到困惑不解。这些痕迹是游牧人留下的，他们生活在从公元前约35，000年到公元前10，000年的冰川期的末期，以狩猎、捕鱼为生。历史学家通过把世界各地留下的这种痕迹放在一起研究，终于弄懂了这种费解的代码。他们发现代码与昼夜更迭和月亮圆缺有关，事实上是一种最原始的日历。大家早就知道，画在墙上的狩猎图景并不是单纯的艺术表现形式，它们有着一定的含义，因为它们已接近古代人的文字形式。有时，这种图画与墙壁上的刻痕共存，它们之间可能有一定的联系。看来人类早就致力于探索四季变迁了，比人们想像的要早20,000年。



## Lesson 39 Nothing to worry about

3

What was the differnce between Bruce's behaviour and that of other people?

4

The rough road across the plain soon became so bad that we tried to get Bruce to drive back to the village we had come from.

5

Even though the road was littered with boulders and pitted with holes, Bruce was not in the least perturbed.

6

Glancing at his map, he informed us that the next village was a mere twenty miles away.

7

It was not that Bruce always underestimated difficulties.

8

He simply had no sense of danger at all.

9

No matter what the conditions were, he believed that a car should be driven as fast as it could possibly go.

10

As we bumped over the dusty track, we swerved to avoid large boulders.

11

The wheels scooped up stones which hammered ominously under the car.

12

We felt sure that sooner or later a stone would rip a hole in our petrol tank or damage the engine.

13

Because of this, we kept looking back, wondering if we were leaving a trail of oil and petrol behind us.

14

What a relief it was when the boulders suddenly disappeared,

15

giving way to a stretch of plain where the only obstacles were clumps bushes.

16

But there was worse to come. Just ahead of us there was a huge fissure.

17

In response to renewed pleadings, Bruce stopped.

18

Though we all got out to examine the fissure, he remained in the car.

19

We informed him that the fissure extended for fifty yards and was two feet wide and four feet deep.

20

Even this had no effect.

21

Bruce went into a low gear and drove at a terrifying speed,

22

keeping the front wheels astride the crack as he followed its zigzag course.

23

Before we had time to worry about what might happen, we were back on the plain again.

24

Bruce consulted the map once more and told us that the village was now only fifteen miles away.

25

Our next obstacle was a shallow pool of water about half a mile across.

26

Bruce charged at it, but in the middle, the car came to a grinding halt.

27

A yellow light on the dashboard flashed angrily

28

and Bruce cheerfully announced that there was no oil in the engine!

59

穿越平原的道路高低不平，开车走了不远，路面愈加崎岖。我们想劝说布鲁斯把车开回我们出发的那个村庄去。尽管路面布满石头，坑坑洼洼，但布鲁斯却一点儿不慌乱。他瞥了一眼地图，告诉我们前面再走不到20英里就是一个村庄。这并不是说布鲁斯总是低估困难，而是他压根儿没有一点儿危险感。他认为不管路面情况如何，车必须以最高速度前进。

60

我们在尘士飞扬的道路上颠簸，车子东拐西弯，以躲开那些大圆石。车轮搅起的石块锤击车身，发出不祥的锤击声。我们想念迟早会飞起一个石块把油箱砸开一个窟窿，或者把发动机砸坏。因此，我们不时地掉过头，怀疑车后是否留下了机油和汽油的痕迹。

61

突然大石块不见了，前面是一片平地，唯一的障碍只有一簇簇灌木丛。这使我们长长地松了口气。但是更糟糕的事情在等着我们，离我们不远处，出现一个大裂缝。我们再次央求布鲁斯小心，他这才把车停了下来。我们纷纷下车察看那个大裂缝，他却呆在车上。我们告诉他那个大裂缝长50码，宽2英尺，深4英尺。这也没有对他产生任何影响。布鲁斯挂上慢档，把两只前轮分别搁在裂缝的两边，顺着弯弯曲曲的裂缝，以发疯的速度向前开去。我们还未来得及担心后果，车已重新开上了平地。布鲁斯又看了一眼地图，告诉我们那座村庄离我们只有15英里了。下一个障碍是一片约半英里宽的浅水塘。布鲁斯向水塘冲去，但车开到水塘当中，嘎吱一声停住了。仪表盘一盏黄灯闪着刺眼的光芒，布鲁斯兴致勃勃地宣布发动机里没油了！







## Lesson 40 Who's who

3

How did the policeman discover that the whole thing was a joke?

4

It has never been explained why university students seem to enjoy practical jokes more than anyone else.

5

Students specialize in a particular type of practical joke: the hoax.

6

Inviting the fire brigade to put out a nonexistent fire is a crude form of deception

7

which no self-respecting student would ever indulge in.

8

Students often create amusing situations which are funny to everyone except the victims.

9

When a student recently saw two workmen using a pneumatic drill outside his university,

10

he immediately telephoned the police and informed them that two students dressed up as workmen

11

were tearing up the road with a pneumatic drill.

12

As soon as he had hung up,

13

he went over to the workmen and told them that if a policeman ordered them to go away,

14

they were not to take him seriously.

15

He added that a student had dressed up as a policeman and was playing all sorts of silly jokes on people.

16

Both the police and the workmen were grateful to the student for this piece of advance information.

17

The student hid in an archway nearby where he could watch and hear everything that went on.

18

Sure enough, a policeman arrived on the scene and politely asked the workmen to go away.

19

When he received a very rude reply from one of the workmen, he threatened to remove them by force.

20

The workmen told him to do as he pleased and the policeman telephoned for help.

21

Shortly afterwards, 4 more policemen arrived and remonstrated with the workmen.

22

As the men refused to stop working,

23

the police attempted to seize the pneumatic drill.

24

The workmen struggled fiercely and one of them lost his temper.

25

He threatened to call the police.

26

At this, the police pointed out ironically that this would hardly be necessary as the men were already under arrest.

27

Pretending to speak seriously,

28

one of the workmen asked if he might make a telephone call before being taken to the station.

29

Permission was granted and a policeman accompanied him to a pay phone.

30

Only when he saw that the man was actually telephoning the police did he realize that they had all been the victims of a hoax.

谁也弄不清为什么大学生好像比任何人都更喜欢恶作剧。大学生擅长一种特殊的恶作剧--戏弄人。请消防队来扑灭一场根本没有的大火是一种低级骗局，有自尊心的大学生决不会去做。大学生们常常做的是制造一种可笑的局面，使大家笑上一场，当然受害者是笑不出来的。

36

最近有个学生看见两个工人在学校门外用风钻干活，马上打电话报告警察，说有两个学生装扮成工人，正在用风钻破坏路面。挂上电话后，他又马上来到工人那儿，告诉他们若有个警察来让他们走开，不要把他当回事，还对工人说，有个学生常装扮成警察无聊地同别人开玩笑。警察与工人都对那个学生事先通报情况表示感谢。

37

那个学生躲在附近一拱形的门廊里，在那儿可以看见、听到现场发生的一切。果然，警察来了，不礼貌地请工人离开此地；但其中一个工人粗鲁地回了几句。于是警察威胁要强行使他们离开。工人说，悉听尊便。警察去打电话叫人。一会儿工夫，又来了4个警察，规劝工人离开。由于工人拒绝停下手中的活，警察想夺风钻。两个工人奋力抗争，其中一个发了火，威胁说要去叫警察。警察听后讥讽地说，这大可不必，因为他俩已被逮捕了。其中一个工人装模作样地问道，在被带往警察局之前，是否可以打一个电话。警察同意了，陪他来到一个投币地电话前，当他看到那个工人真的是给警察挂电话，才恍然大悟，原来他们都成一场骗局的受害者。
