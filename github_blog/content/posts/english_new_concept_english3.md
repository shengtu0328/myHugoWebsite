## Lesson 1 A puma at large 逃遁的美洲狮

Pumas are large, cat-like animals which are found in America. When reports came into London Zoo that a wild puma had been spotted forty-five miles south of London, they were not taken seriously. However（加了逗号however是副词，没有逗号当连词用）, as the evidence began to accumulate, experts from the Zoo felt obliged to investigate, for the descriptions given by people who claimed to have seen the puma were extraordinarily similar.

The hunt for the puma began in a small village where a woman picking blackberries saw 'a large cat' only five yards away from her. It immediately ran away when she saw it, and experts confirmed （confirmed跟了一个宾语从句）that a puma will （宾语从句这里用will 因为这句话是一个客观事实）not attack a human being unless it is cornered. The search proved （prove是系动词 ）difficult, for the puma was often observed at one place in the morning and at another place twenty miles away in the evening. Wherever it went, it left behind it a trail of dead deer and small animals like rabbits. Paw prints were seen in a number of places and puma fur was found clinging to bushes. Several people complained of "cat-like noises' at night and a businessman on a fishing trip saw the puma up a tree. The experts were now fully convinced that the animal was a puma, but where had it come from? As no pumas had been reported missing from any zoo in the country, this one must have been （ must have been 虚拟语气 表示推测）in the possession of a private collector and somehow managed to escape. The hunt went on for several weeks, but the puma was not caught. It is disturbing to think that a dangerous wild animal is still at large in the quiet countryside.

**Notes on the text 课文注释**

1 at large是介词短语，此处表示“逍遥自在”、“行动自由”的意思。
2 When reports came into London Zoo that a wild puma had been spotted forty-five miles south of London, 当伦敦动物园接到报告说，在伦敦以南45英里的地方发现一头野生美洲狮时。这个从句中以that引导的从句是reports的同位语，用于进一步说明报告的内容。

 However（加了逗号however是副词，没有逗号当连词用）, as the evidence began to accumulate, experts from the Zoo felt obliged to investigate, for the descriptions given by people who claimed to have seen the puma were extraordinarily similar.

 as the evidence began to accumulate,

, for the descriptions given by people who claimed to have seen the puma were extraordinarily similar.

这两句都是状语从句， claimed to have seen 不定式 to haven seen动作的发生比claimed 要早



3 feel obliged to do sth. 是“感到不得不做某事”的意思。
4 it left behind it a trail of, 它身后留下一串……。 句末重心原则 原句应该是 left a trail ofxxx   behind it          svoo  宾语补语  behind it作补语 a trail ofxxx is behind it
a trail of作left的宾语，behind it是状语，提到宾语之前是为了使句子结构更紧凑。
5 puma fur was found clinging to bushes中，clinging是现在分词， clinging to bushes此处作主语puma fur的主语补足语。下文中As no pumas had been reported missing…一句中，missing也是现在分词作主语补足语。



 saw the puma up a tree.  up a tree. 是  puma  的补语

The experts were now fully convinced that the animal was a puma, but where had it come from

 that the animal was a puma, 可以看做是状语从句  where had it come from，had是were now fully convinced过去的过去

6 in the possession of, 为……所有。



manage to do 表示成功地完成某件较为困难或具有挑战性的事情。这个短语通常用于强调某人克服了困难或障碍，最终达成了目标。



**参考译文**

美洲狮是一种体形似猫的大动物，产于美洲。当伦敦动物园接到报告说，在伦敦以南45英里处发现一只美洲狮时，这些报告并没有受到重视。可是，随着证据越来越多，动物园的专家们感到有必要进行一番调查，因为凡是声称见到过美洲狮的人们所描述的情况竟是出奇地相似。

pumas are large,cat-like animasl.which are found in america.when the report  came into london zoo that a puma had been spotted froty-five miles  south of london.  these reports were not taken seriously. howerver,as the  evidence began to accumlate,.the expert  from zoo felt obliged to investigate,for the discription given  by people who claimed to have seeen the puma were extraordinarily similar.

**搜寻**美洲狮的工作是从一座小村庄开始的。那里的一位妇女在采摘黑莓时的看见“一只大猫”，离她仅5码远，她刚看见它，它就立刻逃走了。专家证实，美洲狮非被逼得走投无路，是决不会伤人的。事实上搜寻工作很困难，因为常常是早晨在甲地发现那只美洲狮，晚上却在20英里外的乙地发现它的踪迹。无论它**走**哪儿，一路上总会留下一串死鹿及死兔子之类的小动物，在许多地方看见爪印，灌木丛中发现了粘在上面的美洲狮**毛**。有人抱怨说夜里听见“像猫一样的叫声”；一位商人去钓鱼，看见那只美洲狮在树上。专家们如今已经完全肯定那只动物就是美洲狮，但它是从哪儿来的呢？由于全国动物园没有一家报告丢了美洲狮，因此那只美洲狮一定是某位私人收藏豢养的，不知怎么**设法**逃出来了。搜寻工作**进行**了好几个星期，但始终未能逮住那只美洲狮。想到在宁静的乡村里有一头危险的野兽继续逍遥流窜，真令人**担心**。

## Lesson 2 Thirteen equals one 十三等于一



Our vicar is always raising money for one cause or another, but he has never managed （to get enough money )(to have the church clock repaired状语). The big clock which used to strike the hours day and night was damaged many years ago and has been silent ever since.

One night, however, our vicar woke up with a start: the clock was striking the hours! Looking at his watch, he saw that it was one o'clock, but the bell struck thirteen times before it stopped. Armed with a torch, the vicar went up into the clock tower to see what was going on. In the torchlight, he caught sight of a figure whom he immediately recognized as Bill Wilkins, our local grocer.

'Whatever are you doing up here Bill?' asked the vicar in surprise.
'I'm trying to repair the bell,' answered Bill. 'I've been coming up here night after night for weeks now. You see, I was hoping to give you a surprise.'
'You certainly did give me a surprise!' said the vicar. 'You've probably woken up everyone in the village as well. Still, I'm glad the bell is working again.'
That's the trouble, vicar,' answered Bill. 'It's working all right, but I'm afraid that at one o'clock it will strike thirteen times and there's nothing I can do about it."
We'll get used to that, Bill,' said the vicar. "Thirteen is not as good as one, but it's better than nothing. Now let's go downstairs and have a cup of tea.'

**New words and expressions 生词和短语**

vicar n.牧师
raise v.募集，筹（款）
torchlight n.电筒光

 torch n.手电筒



sight n.看见的东西

1 woke up with a start:...
with a start,由于受到惊动，惊醒了。冒号后面是一个解释性的分句，是对start所作的具体说明。

冒号后面可以跟短语 ，句子。但冒号后的句子开头要小些，且句子是起到补充说明的意思2 recognize as,认出是。 he immediately recognized （whom ）as Bill Wilkins 定语从句

3 Whatever are you doing up here?你究竟在这上面干什么。
whatever 用于疑问句中，用以加强 what 的语气，作“究竟什么”解，口语中很常用。
4 You certainly did give me a surprise!你确实使我感到意外！
在英语中助动词 do 可以用来表示强调。此时助动词do放在谓语动词之前。
5 Thirteen is not as good as one,but it is better than nothing.
敲 13下虽然不如敲 1下好，但总比1下不敲强多了。

 （get used to） 看成一个动词

**参考译文**

我们教区的牧师总是为各种各样的事筹集资金。但始终未能筹足资金把教堂的钟修好。教堂的钟很大，以前不分昼夜**打点报时**，但很多年前遭到毁坏，从此便无声无息了。

our vicar is always raising money for **one cause or another** ，but he has  never  managed to get enough money to have the  church clock repaired . 

the big clock which used to strike the hours day and night  was damaged many years ago  and has been silent ever since 



一天夜里，我们的牧师突然被惊醒了，大钟**又在**“打点”报时了！他一看表，才1点钟，**可是**那钟一边敲了13下才停。牧师拿着一支电筒走上钟楼想去看看究竟**发生了什么事情**。借着电筒光。他看见一个人，马上认出那是本地杂货店主比尔.威尔金斯。

on night，our vicar **woke up with a start**，the big clock was  striking the hours again。

looking his watch, he saw that it was one o clock.

but the bell struck thirteen  times  before it stopped，

“你究竟在这上面干什么，比尔？”牧师惊讶地问。

whaterver are you doing here,bill, asked the vicar in surprise

“我**想****把**这口钟修好，”比尔回答说。“好几个星期了，我天天夜里到钟楼上来。嗯，我是**想**让你大吃一惊。”''

“你**确实**使我大吃了一惊！”牧师说，“**也许**同时你把村里所有的人都吵醒了。不过，钟又能报时了，我还是很高兴的。”

your **certainly**  did  give me  a   surprise ，said the vicar， probably  you have woken up everyone in the village **as well,** still. i m glad the bell is working again;

“**问题**就在这里，牧师，”比尔回答说。“不错，钟能报时了，但是，**恐怕**每到1点钟，它总要敲13下，对此我已无能为力了。”

that s the **trouble** ,vicar,  answer bill,   ，it's working all right， but  I'm afraid that  

it will strike thirteen times at one o'cloc and  there is nothing i can do about it。

“大家慢慢就习惯了，比尔，”牧师说。“13下是不如1下好，但总比1下也不敲强。来，咱们下楼去喝杯茶吧。”

We'll get used to that， bill，said the vicar ， thirteen is not as  good as one， but it is better than nothing  Now let's go downstairs and have a cup of tea.'

## Lesson 3 An unknown goddess 无名女神



Some time ago, an interesting discovery was made by archaeologists on the Aegean island of Kea. An American team explored a temple which stands in an ancient city on the promontory of Ayia Irini. The city at one time must have been prosperous, for it enjoyed a high level of civilization. Houses, often three storeys high, were built of stone. They had large rooms with beautifully decorated walls. The city was even equipped with a drainage system, for a great many clay pipes were found beneath the narrow streets.

The temple which the archaeologists explored was used as a place of worship from the 15th century B.C. until Roman times. In the most sacred room of the temple, clay fragments of 15 statues were found. Each of these represented a goddess **and had, at one time, been painted.**

The body of one statue was found among remains dating from the 15th century B.C. Its missing head happened to be among remains of the 5th century B.C. This head must have been found in Classical times and carefully preserved. It was very old and precious even then. When the archaeologists reconstructed the fragments, they were amazed to find(amazed  原因状语) that the goddess turned out to be(the goddess主语补语） a very modern-looking woman. She stood three feet high and her hands rested on her hips.

She was wearing a full-length skirt which swept the ground. Despite her great age, she was very graceful indeed, but, so far, the archaeologists have been unable to discover her identity.

## Lesson 4 The double life of Alfred Bloggs

These days, people who do manual work often receive far（far是副词） more money than people who work in offices. People who work in offices are frequently referred to as "white-collar workers' for the simple reason that they usually wear a collar and tie to go to work. Such is human nature, that a great many people are often willing to sacrifice higher pay for the privilege of becoming white-collar workers. **This can give rise to curious situations, as it did in the case of Alfred Bloggs who worked as a dustman for the Ellesmere Corporation.**

When he got married, Alf was too embarrassed to say anything to his wife about his job. He simply told her that he worked for the Corporation. Every morning, he left home dressed in a smart black suit. He then changed into overalls and spent the next eight hours as a dustman. Before returning home at night. He took a shower and changed back into his suit. Alf did this for over two years and his fellow dustmen kept his secret Alf's wife has never discovered that she married a dustman and she never will, for Alf has just found another job. He will soon be working in an office. He will be earning only half as much as he used to, but he feels that his rise in status is well worth the loss of money. From now on, he will wear a suit all day and others will call him 'Mr. Bloggs', not 'Alf'.

as "white-collar workers'  介词短语

2 for the simple reason that…这里 that引导的从句是 the reason的同位语。
3 Such is human nature, that…
such位于句首，起强调作用，后面要用倒装语序， that引导的是 such的同位语从句。

worth是介词  worth the loss of money.介词短语

**参考译文**

**如今**，**从事**体力劳动的人的收入**一般**要比坐办公室的人高出许多。坐办公室的之所以**常常**被称作“白领工人”，就是**因为**他们通常是穿着硬领白**衬衫**，系着领带去上班。许多人常常情愿放弃较高的薪水以换取做白领工人的**殊荣**，**此乃人之常情**。而这常常会**引起种种奇怪的现象**，在埃尔斯米尔公司当清洁工的艾尔弗雷德.布洛斯就**是一个例子**。

##  Lesson 5 The facts 确切数字


Editors of newspapers and magazines often go to extremes to provide their readers with unimportant facts and statistics. Last year a journalist had been instructed by a well-known magazine to write an article on the president's palace in a new African republic. When the article arrived, the editor read the first sentence and then refused to publish it. The article began: ‘Hundreds of steps lead to the high wall which surrounds the president's palace. ’The editor at once sent the journalist a fax instructing（现在分词作后置定语） him to find out the exact number of steps and the height of the wall.

 The journalist immediately set out to obtain these important facts, but he took a long time to send them Meanwhile, the editor was getting impatient, for the magazine would(使用 "would soon" 是因为主句使用了过去时态) soon go to press. He sent the journalist two more faxes, but received no reply. He sent yet（**yet**作副词，adv. 又） another fax informing the journalist that if he did not reply soon he would be fired. When the journalist again failed to reply, the editor reluctantly published the article as it had originally been written. A week later, the editor at last received a fax from the journalist. Not only had the poor man been arrested, but he had been sent to prison as well. However, he had at last been allowed to send a fax in which he informed the editor that the he had been arrested while counting the 1,084 steps leading to the fifteen-foot wall which surrounded the president's palace.

## Lesson 6 Smash-and-grab 砸橱窗抢劫

The expensive shops in a famous arcade near Piccadilly were just opening. At this time of the morning, the arcade was almost empty. Mr. Taylor, the owner of a jewellery shop was admiring a new window display. Two of his assistants had been working busily since eight o'clock and had only just finished. Diamond necklaces and rings had been beautifully arranged on a background of black velvet. After gazing at the display for several minutes, Mr. Taylor went back into his shop.

The silence was suddenly broken when a large car, with its headlights on and its horn blaring, roared down the arcade. It came to a stop outside the jeweller's. One man stayed at the wheel while two others with black stockings over their faces jumped out and smashed the window of the shop with iron bars. While this was going on, Mr. Taylor was upstairs. He and his staff began throwing furniture out of the window. Chairs and tables went flying into the arcade. One of the thieves was struck by a heavy statue, but he was too busy helping himself to diamonds to notice any pain. The raid was all over in three minutes, for the men scrambled back into the car and it moved off at a fantastic speed. Just as it was leaving, Mr. Taylor rushed out and ran after it throwing ashtrays and vases, but it was impossible to stop the thieves. They had got away with thousands of pounds worth of diamonds.

## Lesson 7 Mutilated ladies 残钞鉴别组

Has it ever happened to you? Have you ever put your trousers in the washing machine and then remembered there was a large bank note in your back pocket? When you rescued your trousers, did you find the note was whiter than white? People who live in Britain needn't despair when they make mistakes like this(and a lot of people do)! Fortunately for them, the Bank of England has a team called Mutilated Ladies which deals with claims from people who fed their money to a machine or to their dog. Dogs, it seems, love to chew up money!

A recent case concerns Jane Butlin whose fiancé, John, runs a successful furniture business. John had a very good day and put his wallet containing ￡ 3, 000 into the microwave oven for safekeeping. Then he and Jane went horse-riding. When they got home, Jane cooked their dinner in the microwave oven and without realizing it, cooked her fiancé's wallet as well. Imagine their dismay when they found a beautifully-cooked wallet and notes turned to ash! John went to see his bank manager who sent the remains of wallet and the money to the special department of the Bank of England in Newcastle: the Mutilated Ladies! They examined the remains and John got all his money back. ‘So long as there's something to identify, we will give people their money back, ’said a spokeswoman for the Bank. ‘Last year, we paid ￡ 1. 5m on 21, 000 claims. ’

\* Damaged bank notes. The Queen's head appears on English bank notes，and‘lady’refers to this.

1 Mutilated ladies，这是英国银行专门负责识别和鉴定残缺或被毁纸币的小组，其中的 lady是指英国纸币上印的女王头像。
2 a large bank note，面额很大的纸币。
3 whiter than white，这是英国有关洗衣粉的电视广告中常用的一句话。这里的意思是纸币上的字迹、图案均被洗掉了，可以译为“比白纸还白”。
4 they found a beautifully-cooked wallet and notes turned to ash，他们发现一只煮得很好看的钱包，钞票已烧成了灰。后半句 they found… notes turned to ash中过去分词短语 turned to ash作宾语 notes的补足语，这后半句话可以看成 they found… that notes had been turned to ash。

## Lesson 8 A famous monastery 著名的修道院



The Great St. Bernard Pass connects Switzerland to Italy. At 2, 473 metres, it is the highest mountain pass in Europe. The famous monastery of St. Bernard, which was founded in the eleventh century, lies about a mile away. For hundreds of years, St. Bernard dogs have saved the lives of travellers crossing the dangerous Pass. These friendly dogs, which were first brought from Asia, were used as watchdogs even in Roman times. **Now that** a tunnel has been built through the mountains, the Pass is less dangerous, but each year, the dogs are still sent out into the snow whenever a traveller is in difficulty. Despite the new tunnel, there are still a few people who rashly attempt to cross the Pass on foot.

During the summer months, the monastery is very busy, for it is visited by thousands of people who cross the Pass in cars. As there are so many people about, the dogs have to be kept in a special enclosure. In winter, however, life at the monastery is quite different. The temperature drops to-30°and very few people attempt to cross the Pass. The monks prefer winter to summer for they have more privacy. The dogs have greater freedom, too, for they are allowed to wander outside their enclosure. The only regular visitors to the monastery in winter are parties of skiers who go there at Christmas and Easter. These young people, who love the peace of the mountains, always receive a warm welcome at St. Bernard's monastery.

Cats never fail to fascinate human beings. They can be friendly and **affectionate** towards humans, but they **lead** mysterious lives of their own as well. They never become **submissive** like dogs and horses. As a result, humans have learned to respect **feline** independence. Most cats remain **suspicious** of humans all their lives. One of the things that fascinates us most about cats is the popular belief that they have nine lives. Apparently, there is **a good deal** of truth in this idea. A cat's ability to survive falls is based on fact.

Recently the New York Animal Medical Centre made a study of 132 cats over a period of five months. All these cats had one experience in common: they had fallen off high buildings, **yet** only eight of them died from shock or injuries. Of course, New York is the ideal place for such an interesting study, because there is **no shortage of** tall buildings. There are plenty of **high-rise** **windowsills** to fall, from! One cat, Sabrina, fell 32 **storeys**, yet only **suffered from** a broken tooth. ‘Cats behave like well-trained **paratroopers**, ’ a doctor said. It seems that the further cats fall, the less they **are likely to** injure themselves. In a long drop, they reach speeds of 60 miles an hour and more. At high speeds, falling cats have time to relax. They stretch out their legs like flying squirrels. This increases their air-resistance and reduces the shock of impact when they hit the ground.

**Notes on the text 课文注释**

1 Cats never fail to fascinate human beings. 在这句话中有一个否定词 never和一个含有否定意义的动词 fail，这两个否定词就组成了双重否定，而双重否定往往用来表示肯定。这句话可以译成：“猫总能引起人们的极大兴趣。”
2 be based on，在……基础之上。
3 have in common，有共同之处。
4 the further cats fall, the less they are likely to injure themselves，猫跌落的距离越长，它们就越不会伤害自己。“the +形容词或副词比较级…the +形容词或副词比较级”的结构常用来表示比较关系，往往可以译成“越……越……”。 be likely to是“很可能会”的意思。

**参考译文**

猫总能引起人们的极大兴趣。它们可以**对人**友好，充满柔情。但是，它们又有自己神秘的生活方式。它们从不**像**狗和马一样变得那么顺从。**结果是**人们已经学会尊重猫的独立性。**在它们的一生中**，大多数猫都**对**人存有戒心。最使我们**感兴趣**的一件事情就是一种**通俗的信念**——猫有九条命。显然，这种**说法**里面包含着许多真实性。猫在跌落时能够**大难不死**是有事实作为依据的。



Cats never fail to fascinate human beings。The can be friendly  and  affectionate towards humans，but

 they lead mysterious lives of their own as well。

They never become **submissive**   **like** dogs and horses. 

 **As a result**, humans have learned to respect **feline** independence. 



Most cats **remain** **suspicious** of humans **all their lives**.

One of the things that **fascinates** us most about cats is the **popular belief** that they have nine lives. 

Apparently, there is **a good deal of **  truth **in** this idea

A cat's **ability** to survive falls is based on fact.



**最近**，纽约动物医疗中心对132只猫**进行**了**为期**5个月的综合**研究**。所有这些猫都有一个**共同的**经历：它们都曾从高层建筑上摔下来过，**但**只有其中的8只猫死于震荡或跌伤。**当然**，纽约是**进行**这种有趣的**试验**的一个理想的地方，因为那里根本不缺乏高楼大厦，**有的是**高层的窗槛从上往下坠落。有一只叫萨伯瑞娜的猫从32层楼上掉下来，**但**只摔断了一颗牙。“猫就**像**训练有素的跳伞队员，”一位医生说。**看起来**，猫跌落的距离越长，它们就越不会伤害自己。在一个长长的跌落过程中，它们可以达到每小时60英里甚至更快的速度。**在高速下落中**，猫有时间放松自己。它们伸展开**四肢**，就像飞行中的松鼠一样。这样就**加大**了空气阻力，并**减小**了它们**着地**时冲击力带来的震动。

## Lesson 10 The loss of the Titanic ＂泰坦尼克＂号的沉没


What would have happened if only two of the sixteen water-tight compartments had been flooded?

The great ship, Titanic, **sailed for** New York from Southampton on April 10th, 1912. She was carrying 1, 316 passengers and a crew of 891. Even by modern standards, the 46, 000 ton Titanic was a **colossal** ship**. At that time**, however, she was not only the largest ship that had ever been built, but was regarded as unsinkable, for she had sixteen **watertight** **compartments**. Even if two of these were **flooded**, she would still be able to float. The tragic sinking of this great **liner** will always be remembered, for she went down on her first **voyage** with heavy loss of life.

Four days after **setting out**, while the Titanic was sailing across the icy waters of the North Atlantic, a huge iceberg was suddenly spotted by a lookout. After the alarm had been given, the great ship turned **sharply** to avoid a direct collision. The Titanic turned just in time, **narrowly** missing the immense wall of ice which rose over 100 feet out of the water beside her. Suddenly, there was a **slight** **trembling** sound from below, and the captain went down to see what had happened. The noise had been so **faint** that no one thought that the ship had been damaged. Below, the captain realized to his **horror** that the Titanic was sinking rapidly, for five of her sixteen watertight compartments had already been flooded! The order to abandon ship was given and hundreds of people **plunged** into the icy water. As there were not enough lifeboats for everybody, 1, 500 lives were lost.

## Lesson 11 Not guilty 无罪


What was the Customs Officer looking for?



Customs Officers are quite tolerant these days, but they can still stop you when you are going through the Green Channel and have nothing to declare. Even really honest people are often made to feel guilty. The hardened professional smuggler, on the other hand, is never troubled by such feelings, even if he has five hundred gold watches hidden in his suitcase. When I returned from abroad recently, a particularly officious young Customs Officer clearly regarded me as a smuggler.

‘Have you anything to declare? ’ he asked, looking me in the eye.
‘No, ’ I answered confidently.
‘Would you mind unlocking （mind 后面一般加动名词）this suitcase please? ’
‘Not at all, ’ I answered.

The Officer went through the case with great care. All the things I had packed so carefully were soon in a dreadful mess. I felt sure I would never be able to close the case again. Suddenly, I saw the Officer's face light, up. He had spotted a tiny bottle at the bottom of my case and he pounced on it with delight.

‘Perfume, eh? ’ he asked sarcastically. ‘You should have declared that. Perfume is not exempt from import duty. ’
‘But it isn't perfume, ’ I said. ‘It's hair gel. ’ Then I added with a smile, ‘It's a strange mixture I make myself. ’
As I expected, he did not believe me.
‘Try it!’I said encouragingly.

The Officer unscrewed the cap and put the bottle to his nostrils. He was greeted by an unpleasant smell which convinced him that I was telling the truth. A few minutes later, I was able to hurry away with precious chalk marks on my baggage.

改成主动    someone  made honset people   feel  guilty.  （ to feel guilty 不定式作people宾语补,   因为是made使役动词，to 省略， 但是people 受到 made 制约）



‘Have you anything to declare?      古文版  √

Do you have anything to declare？  标准  √







1 the Green Channel，绿色通道，指海关专供没有携带征税物品进关的旅客所走的通道。
2 hidden in his suitcase是过去分词短语作定语，修饰watches，它相当于一个定语从句：which were hidden in his suitcase.
3 looking me in the eye，直盯着我的眼睛，这是分词短语作状语，表示方式，修饰 asked。

4 The officer went through，这里go through作“检查”讲。
5 in a dreadful mess （或 in a mess），乱七八糟，混乱透了。
6 I saw the Officer's face light up．我看到那位官员的脸上露出了得意的神色。 在使用使役动词（如 "make"、"let"）或感官动词（如 "see"、"hear"、"watch"，看到你做了，那你已经做了，所以可以去掉to，to有将来的意思）时，后面的动词通常用原形。light up 是宾语补语



I saw the Officer's face lighting up表示一个时刻

I saw the Officer's face light up 表示过程



7 You should have declared that．你早该申报了。“should +不定式的完成式”表示本该做而未做之事。
8 be exempt from 作“免除”、“豁免”解。



使役动词let，make，have等，感官动词see，hear，feel，watch，notice，look at，listen to等，后常跟不带to的不定式作宾语补足语。例如：

**参考译文**

**现在的**海关官员往往相当宽容。但是，当你**通过**绿色通道，没有任何东西需要申报时，他们仍可以拦住你。甚至是最诚实的人也常**被弄得**觉得有罪似的，而老练的职业走私犯即使在手提箱里**藏**着500只金表，**却**也**处之泰然**。最近一次，我出国**归来**，碰上一位**特别 ****好管闲事**的年轻海关官员，他**显然**把我**当**成了走私犯。

## Lesson 12 Life on a desert island 荒岛生活


What was exceptional about the two men's stay on the desert island?

Most of us have formed an unrealistic picture of life on a desert island. We sometimes imagine a desert island to be a sort of paradise where the sun always shines. Life there is simple and good. Ripe fruit falls from the trees and you never have to work. The other side of the picture is quite the opposite. Life on a desert island is wretched. You either starve to death or live like Robinson Crusoe, waiting for a boat which never comes. Perhaps there is an element of truth in both these pictures, but few of us have had the opportunity to find out.

Two men who recently spent five days on a coral island wished they had stayed there longer. They were taking a badly damaged boat from the Virgin Islands to Miami to have it repaired. During the journey, their boat began to sink. They quickly loaded a small rubber dinghy with food, matches, and cans of beer and rowed for a few miles across the Caribbean until they arrived at a tiny coral island. There were hardly any trees on the island and there was no water, but this did not prove to be a problem. The men collected rainwater in the rubber dinghy. As they had brought a spear gun with them, they had plenty to eat. Theycaught lobster and fish every day, and, as one of them put it ‘ate like kings’. When a passing tanker rescued them five days later, both men were genuinely sorry that they had to leave.

## Lesson 13 It's only me 是我，别害怕

What did the man expect to find under the stairs?

After her husband had gone to work, Mrs. Richards sent her children to school and went upstairs to her bedroom. She was too excited to do any housework that morning, **for in the evening she would be going to** a fancy-dress party with her husband. She intended to dress up as a ghost and as she had made her costume the night before, she was impatient to try it on. Though the costume consisted only of a sheet, it was very effective. After putting it on, Mrs Richards went downstairs. She wanted to find out whether it would be comfortable to wear.

Just as Mrs. Richards was entering the dining room, there was a knock on the front door. She knew that it must be the baker. She had told him to come straight in if ever she failed to open the door and to leave the bread on the kitchen table. Not wanting to frighten the poor man, Mrs Richards quickly hid in the small storeroom under the stairs. She heard the front door open and heavy footsteps in the hall. Suddenly the door of the storeroom was opened and a man entered, Mrs Richards realized that it must be the man from the Electricity Board who had come to read the metre. She tried to explain the situation, saying‘It's only me’, but it was too late. The man let out a cry and jumped back **several paces**. When Mrs. Richards walked towards him, he fled, slamming the door behind him.

## Lesson 14: A noble **gangster **  贵族歹徒



How did Hawkwood make money in times of peace?

There was a time when the owners of shops and businesses in Chicago

had to pay large sums of money to gangsters in return for 'protection'.

If the money was not paid promptly,

the gangsters would quickly put a man out of business by destroying his shop.

Obtaining 'protection money' is not a modern crime.

As long ago as the fourteenth century,

an Englishman, Sir John Hawkwood,

made the remarkable discovery that people would rather pay large sums of money than have their life work destroyed by gangsters.

Six hundred years ago,

Sir John Hawkwood arrived in Italy with a band of soldiers and settled near Florence.

He soon made a name for himself and came to be known to the Italians as Giovanni Acuto.

Whenever the Italian city-states were at war with each other,

Hawkwood used to hire his soldiers to princes who were willing to pay the high price he demanded.

In times of peace, when business was bad,

Hawkwood and his men would march into a city-state,

and after burning down a few farms, would offer to go away if protection money was paid to them.

Hawkwood made large sums of money in this way.

In spite of this, the Italians regarded him as a sort of hero.

When he died at the age of eighty,

the Florentines gave him a state funeral and had a picture painted which was dedicated to the memory of 'the most valiant soldier and most notable leader, Signor Giovanni Haukodue'.

## Lesson 15 Fifty pence worth of trouble



Did George get anything for his fifty pence? What?

Children always appreciate small gifts of money.

Mum or dad, of course, provides a regular supply of pocket money,

but uncles and aunts are always a source of extra income.

With some children, small sums go a long way.

If fifty pence pieces are not exchanged for sweets,

they rattle for months inside money boxes.

Only very thrifty children manage to fill up a money box.

For most of them, fifty pence is a small price to pay for a nice big bar of chocolate.

My nephew, George, has a money box but it is always empty.

Very few of the fifty pence pieces and pound coins I have given him have found their way there.

I gave him fifty pence yesterday and advised him to save it.

Instead, he bought himself **fifty pence worth of trouble.**

On his way to the sweet shop,

he dropped his fifty pence and it bounced along the pavement and then disappeared down a drain.

George took off his jacket,

rolled up his sleeves and pushed his right arm through the drain cover.

He could not find his 50 pence piece anywhere, and what is more, he could not get his arm out.

A crowd of people gathered round him and a lady rubbed his arm with soap and butter,

but George was firmly stuck.

The fire brigade was called and two fire fighters **freed** George using a special type of grease.

George was not too upset by his experience,

because the lady who owns the sweet shop heard about his troubles and rewarded him with a large box of chocolates.

**Notes on the text课文注释**
1 with some children, 介词with此处作“对于”讲。
2 go a long way, 可以维持很久。
3 If fifty pence pieces are not exchanged for sweets, 如果50便士的分币没有用来换糖果的话。exchange…for…作“以……换……”讲，注意英语中的便士有两种复数形式pence和pennies, 但用法不同。如：a fifty pence是指1个50便士的硬币，而fifty pennies是指50个1便士的硬币。
4 have found their way there, 其中there是指储蓄罐。find one's way在这里作“进入”讲，即放到“储蓄罐”里。
5 what is more, 更有甚者。是固定词组，此处用作插入语。



small gifts of money/ gifts of money 零花钱

孩子们总是喜欢得到一些零花钱。爸爸妈妈当然经常**给**孩子零花钱，但是，叔舅婶姨也是孩子们额外收入来源。**对于**有些孩子来说，少量的钱可以花很长一段时间。如果50便士不拿来换糖吃，则可以放在**储蓄罐里**叮当响上好几月。但是能把储蓄罐**装满**的只有**屈指可数**的几个特别节俭的孩子。对大部分孩子来说，用50便士来买一大块好的巧克力，是算不了什么的。
