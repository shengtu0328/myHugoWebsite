## Lesson 1 A puma at large 逃遁的美洲狮

Pumas are large, cat-like animals which are found in America. When reports came into London Zoo that a wild puma had been spotted forty-five miles south of London, they were not taken seriously. However（加了逗号however是副词，没有逗号当连词用）, as the evidence began to accumulate, experts from the Zoo felt obliged to investigate, for the descriptions given by people who claimed to have seen the puma were extraordinarily similar.

The hunt for the puma began in a small village where a woman picking blackberries saw 'a large cat' only five yards away from her. It immediately ran away when she saw it, and experts confirmed （confirmed跟了一个宾语从句）that a puma will （宾语从句这里用will 因为这句话是一个客观事实）not attack a human being unless it is cornered. The search proved （prove是系动词 ）difficult, for the puma was often observed at one place in the morning and at another place twenty miles away in the evening. Wherever it went, it left behind it a trail of dead deer and small animals like rabbits. Paw prints were seen in a number of places and puma fur was found clinging to bushes. Several people complained of "cat-like noises' at night and a businessman on a fishing trip saw the puma up a tree. The experts were now fully convinced that the animal was a puma, but where had it come from? As no pumas had been reported missing from any zoo in the country, this one must have been （ must have been 不是虚拟语气 表示推测）in the possession of a private collector and somehow managed to escape. The hunt went on for several weeks, but the puma was not caught. It is disturbing to think that a dangerous wild animal is still at large in the quiet countryside.

**Notes on the text 课文注释**

1 at large是介词短语，此处表示“逍遥自在”、“行动自由”的意思。
2 When reports came into London Zoo that a wild puma had been spotted forty-five miles south of London, 当伦敦动物园接到报告说，在伦敦以南45英里的地方发现一头野生美洲狮时。这个从句中以that引导的从句是reports的同位语，用于进一步说明报告的内容。

 However（加了逗号however是副词，没有逗号当连词用）, as the evidence began to accumulate, experts from the Zoo felt obliged to investigate, for the descriptions given by people who claimed to have seen the puma were extraordinarily similar.

 as the evidence began to accumulate,

, for the descriptions given by people who claimed to have seen the puma were extraordinarily similar.

这两句都是状语从句， claimed to have seen 不定式 to haven seen动作的发生比claimed 要早



在英语中，**"forty-five miles south of London"** 这种表达方式中不需要加介词。这是因为“south of London”已经是一个方位短语，表示“在伦敦以南”的位置。“forty-five miles”则进一步修饰了这个方位，表示具体的距离。

所以，整个短语 **"forty-five miles south of London"** 可以直接理解为“距离伦敦南方45英里处”，不需要额外的介词。

不过，如果你用介词，也可以，比如：

- **"at a location forty-five miles south of London"**  
  但这会使表达更冗长，通常不这样说。直接使用“forty-five miles south of London”更简洁和自然。

这种结构在英语中很常见，例如：

- **"ten kilometers east of the city"** （在城市以东十公里处）
- **"three blocks north of the station"** （在车站以北三个街区处）



3 feel obliged to do sth. 是“感到不得不做某事”的意思。
4 it left behind it a trail of, 它身后留下一串……。 句末重心原则 原句应该是 left a trail ofxxx   behind it          svoo  宾语补语  behind it作**补语** a trail ofxxx is behind it
5 puma fur was found clinging to bushes中，clinging是现在分词， clinging to bushes此处作主语puma fur的主语补足语。下文中As no pumas had been reported missing…一句中，missing也是现在分词作主语补足语。



 saw the puma up a tree.  up a tree. 是  puma  的补语

The experts were now fully convinced that the animal was a puma, but where had it come from

 that the animal was a puma, 可以看做是状语从句  where had it come from，had是were now fully convinced过去的过去

6 in the possession of, 为……所有。



manage to do 表示成功地完成某件较为困难或具有挑战性的事情。这个短语通常用于强调某人克服了困难或障碍，最终达成了目标。



**参考译文**

美洲狮是一种体形似猫的大动物，产于美洲。当伦敦动物园接到报告说，在伦敦以南45英里处发现一只美洲狮时，这些报告并没有受到重视。可是，随着证据越来越多，动物园的专家们感到有必要进行一番调查，因为凡是声称见到过美洲狮的人们所描述的情况竟是出奇地相似。

pumas are large,cat-like animasl.which are found in america.when the report  came into london zoo that a puma had been spotted froty-five miles  south of london.  these reports were not taken seriously. howerver,as the  evidence began to accumlate,.the expert  from zoo felt obliged to investigate,for the discription given  by people who claimed to have seeen the puma were extraordinarily similar.

**搜寻**美洲狮的工作是从一座小村庄开始的。那里的一位妇女在采摘黑莓时的看见“一只大猫”，离她仅5码远，她刚看见它，它就立刻逃走了。专家证实，美洲狮非被逼得走投无路，是决不会伤人的。事实上搜寻工作很困难，因为常常是早晨在甲地发现那只美洲狮，晚上却在20英里外的乙地发现它的踪迹。无论它**走**哪儿，一路上总会留下一串死鹿及死兔子之类的小动物，在许多地方看见爪印，灌木丛中发现了粘在上面的美洲狮**毛**。有人抱怨说夜里听见“像猫一样的叫声”；一位商人去钓鱼，看见那只美洲狮在树上。专家们如今已经完全肯定那只动物就是美洲狮，但它是从哪儿来的呢？由于全国动物园没有一家报告丢了美洲狮，因此那只美洲狮一定是某位私人收藏豢养的，不知怎么**设法**逃出来了。搜寻工作**进行**了好几个星期，但始终未能逮住那只美洲狮。想到在宁静的乡村里有一头危险的野兽继续逍遥流窜，真令人**担心**。

the hunt for pumas began in a small village  where a women picking blackberries saw a large cat  only 5 yards away from her.

## Lesson 2 Thirteen equals one 十三等于一



Our vicar is always raising money for one cause or another, but he has never managed （to get enough money )(to have the church clock repaired状语). The big clock which used to strike the hours day and night was damaged many years ago and has been silent ever since.

One night, however, our vicar woke up with a start: the clock was striking the hours! Looking at his watch, he saw that it was one o'clock, but the bell struck thirteen times before it stopped. Armed with a torch, the vicar went up into the clock tower to see what was going on. In the torchlight, he caught sight of a figure whom he immediately recognized as Bill Wilkins, our local grocer.

'Whatever are you doing up here Bill?' asked the vicar in surprise.
'I'm trying to repair the bell,' answered Bill. 'I've been coming up here night after night for weeks now. You see, I was hoping to give you a surprise.'
'You certainly did give me a surprise!' said the vicar. 'You've probably woken up everyone in the village as well. Still, I'm glad the bell is working again.'
That's the trouble, vicar,' answered Bill. 'It's working all right, but I'm afraid that at one o'clock it will strike thirteen times and there's nothing I can do about it."
We'll get used to that, Bill,' said the vicar. "Thirteen is not as good as one, but it's better than nothing. Now let's go downstairs and have a cup of tea.'

**New words and expressions 生词和短语**

equal v.等于
vicar n.牧师
raise v.募集，筹（款）
torchlight n.电筒光

 torch n.手电筒



sight n.看见的东西

1 woke up with a start:...
with a start,由于受到惊动，惊醒了。冒号后面是一个解释性的分句，是对start所作的具体说明。

冒号后面可以跟短语 ，句子。但冒号后的句子开头要小些，且句子是起到补充说明的意思2 recognize as,认出是。 he immediately recognized （whom ）as Bill Wilkins 定语从句

3 Whatever are you doing up here?你究竟在这上面干什么。
whatever 用于疑问句中，用以加强 what 的语气，作“究竟什么”解，口语中很常用。
4 You certainly did give me a surprise!你确实使我感到意外！
在英语中助动词 do 可以用来表示强调。此时助动词do放在谓语动词之前。
5 Thirteen is not as good as one,but it is better than nothing.
敲 13下虽然不如敲 1下好，但总比1下不敲强多了。

我们教区的牧师总是为各种各样的事筹集资金。但始终未能筹足资金把教堂的钟修好。教堂的钟很大，以前不分昼夜**打点报时**，但很多年前遭到毁坏，从此便无声无息了。

our vicar is always raising money for **one cause or another** ，but he has  never  managed to get enough money to have the  church clock repaired . 

the big clock which used to strike the hours day and night  was damaged many years ago  and has been silent ever since 



一天夜里，我们的牧师突然被惊醒了，大钟**又在**“打点”报时了！他一看表，才1点钟，**可是**那钟一边敲了13下才停。牧师拿着一支电筒走上钟楼想去看看究竟**发生了什么事情**。借着电筒光。他看见一个人，马上认出那是本地杂货店主比尔.威尔金斯。

on night，our vicar **woke up with a start**，the big clock was  striking the hours again。

looking his watch, he saw that it was one o clock.

but the bell struck thirteen  times  before it stopped，

Armed with a torch, the   vicar went up into the clock tower   to see what was going on  ,  in the torchligh, he saw **a sight of a figure**   whom   he immediatly  recongized  as  bill。wilkins ,our  local grocer



“你究竟在这上面干什么，比尔？”牧师惊讶地问。

whaterver are you doing here,bill, asked the vicar in surprise

“我**想****把**这口钟修好，”比尔回答说。“好几个星期了，我天天夜里到钟楼上来。嗯，我是**想**让你大吃一惊。”''

i  m **trying** to repair this bell, anwsered bill，“l have been coming up here night after night for weeks now. ，you see， i was **hoping** to give your a   surprise”



“你**确实**使我大吃了一惊！”牧师说，“**也许**同时你把村里所有的人都吵醒了。不过，钟又能报时了，我还是很高兴的。”

your **certainly**  did  give me  a   surprise ，said the vicar， probably  you have woken up everyone in the village **as well,** still. i m glad the bell is working again;

“**问题**就在这里，牧师，”比尔回答说。“不错，钟能报时了，但是，**恐怕**每到1点钟，它总要敲13下，对此我已无能为力了。”

that s the **trouble** ,vicar,  answer bill,   ，it's working all right， but  I'm afraid that  

it will strike thirteen times at one o'cloc and  there is nothing i can do about it。

“大家慢慢就习惯了，比尔，”牧师说。“13下是不如1下好，但总比1下也不敲强。来，咱们下楼去喝杯茶吧。”

We'll get used to that， bill，said the vicar ， thirteen is not as  good as one， but it is better than nothing  Now let's go downstairs and have a cup of tea.'

## Lesson 3 An unknown goddess 无名女神



Some time ago, an interesting discovery was made by archaeologists on the Aegean island of Kea. An American team explored a temple which stands in an ancient city on the promontory of Ayia Irini. The city at one time must have been prosperous, for it enjoyed a high level of civilization. Houses, often three storeys high, were built of stone. They had large rooms with beautifully decorated walls. The city was even equipped with a drainage system, for a great many clay pipes were found beneath the narrow streets.

The temple which the archaeologists explored was used as a place of worship from the 15th century B.C. until Roman times. In the most sacred room of the temple, clay fragments of 15 statues were found. Each of these represented a goddess **and had, at one time, been painted.**

The body of one statue was found among remains dating from the 15th century B.C. Its missing head happened to be among remains of the 5th century B.C. This head must have been found in Classical times and carefully preserved. It was very old and precious even then. When the archaeologists reconstructed the fragments, they were amazed to find(amazed  原因状语) that the goddess turned out to be(the goddess主语补语） a very modern-looking woman. She stood three feet high and her hands rested on her hips.

She was wearing a full-length skirt which swept the ground. Despite her great age, she was very graceful indeed, but, so far, the archaeologists have been unable to discover her identity.

## Lesson 4 The double life of Alfred Bloggs

These days, people who do manual work often receive far（far是副词） more money than people who work in offices. People who work in offices are frequently referred to as "white-collar workers' for the simple reason that they usually wear a collar and tie to go to work. Such is human nature, that a great many people are often willing to sacrifice higher pay for the privilege of becoming white-collar workers. **This can give rise to curious situations, as it did in the case of Alfred Bloggs who worked as a dustman for the Ellesmere Corporation.**

When he got married, Alf was too embarrassed to say anything to his wife about his job. He simply told her that he worked for the Corporation. Every morning, he left home dressed in a smart black suit. He then changed into overalls and spent the next eight hours as a dustman. Before returning home at night. He took a shower and changed back into his suit. Alf did this for over two years and his fellow dustmen kept his secret Alf's wife has never discovered that she married a dustman and she never will, for Alf has just found another job. He will soon be working in an office. He will be earning only half as much as he used to, but he feels that his rise in status is well worth the loss of money. From now on, he will wear a suit all day and others will call him 'Mr. Bloggs', not 'Alf'.

2 for the simple reason that…这里 that引导的从句是 the reason的同位语。
3 Such is human nature, that…
such位于句首，起强调作用，后面要用倒装语序， that引导的是 such的同位语从句。

5 half as much as he used to, 只相当于过去的一半。

worth是介词  worth the loss of money.介词短语

**参考译文**

**如今**，**从事**体力劳动的人的收入**一般**要比坐办公室的人高出许多。坐办公室的之所以**常常**被称作“白领工人”，就是**因为**他们通常是穿着硬领白**衬衫**，系着领带去上班。许多人常常情愿放弃较高的薪水以换取做白领工人的**殊荣**，**此乃人之常情**。而这常常会**引起种种奇怪的现象**，在埃尔斯米尔公司当清洁工的艾尔弗雷德.布洛斯就**是一个例子**。

##  Lesson 5 The facts 确切数字


Editors of newspapers and magazines often go to extremes to provide their readers with unimportant facts and statistics. Last year a journalist had been instructed by a well-known magazine to write an article on the president's palace in a new African republic. When the article arrived, the editor read the first sentence and then refused to publish it. The article began: ‘Hundreds of steps lead to the high wall which surrounds the president's palace. ’The editor at once sent the journalist a fax instructing（现在分词作后置定语） him to find out the exact number of steps and the height of the wall.

 The journalist immediately set out to obtain these important facts, but he took a long time to send them Meanwhile, the editor was getting impatient, for the magazine would(使用 "would soon" 是因为主句使用了过去时态) soon go to press. He sent the journalist two more faxes, but received no reply. He sent yet（**yet**作副词，adv. 又） another fax informing the journalist that if he did not reply soon he would be fired. When the journalist again failed to reply, the editor reluctantly published the article as it had originally been written. A week later, the editor at last received a fax from the journalist. Not only had the poor man been arrested, but he had been sent to prison as well. However, he had at last been allowed to send a fax in which he informed the editor that the he had been arrested while counting the 1,084 steps leading to the fifteen-foot wall which surrounded the president's palace.

## Lesson 6 Smash-and-grab 砸橱窗抢劫

The expensive shops in a famous arcade near Piccadilly were just opening. At this time of the morning, the arcade was almost empty. Mr. Taylor, the owner of a jewellery shop was admiring a new window display. Two of his assistants had been working busily since eight o'clock and had only just finished. Diamond necklaces and rings had been beautifully arranged on a background of black velvet. After gazing at the display for several minutes, Mr. Taylor went back into his shop.

The silence was suddenly broken when a large car, with its headlights on and its horn blaring, roared down the arcade. It came to a stop outside the jeweller's. One man stayed at the wheel while two others with black stockings over their faces jumped out and smashed the window of the shop with iron bars. While this was going on, Mr. Taylor was upstairs. He and his staff began throwing furniture out of the window. Chairs and tables went flying into the arcade. One of the thieves was struck by a heavy statue, but he was too busy helping himself to diamonds to notice any pain. The raid was all over in three minutes, for the men scrambled back into the car and it moved off at a fantastic speed. Just as it was leaving, Mr. Taylor rushed out and ran after it throwing ashtrays and vases, but it was impossible to stop the thieves. They had got away with thousands of pounds worth of diamonds.

## Lesson 7 Mutilated ladies 残钞鉴别组

Has it ever happened to you? Have you ever put your trousers in the washing machine and then remembered there was a large bank note in your back pocket? When you rescued your trousers, did you find the note was whiter than white? People who live in Britain needn't despair when they make mistakes like this(and a lot of people do)! Fortunately for them, the Bank of England has a team called Mutilated Ladies which deals with claims from people who fed their money to a machine or to their dog. Dogs, it seems, love to chew up money!

A recent case concerns Jane Butlin whose fiancé, John, runs a successful furniture business. John had a very good day and put his wallet containing ￡ 3, 000 into the microwave oven for safekeeping. Then he and Jane went horse-riding. When they got home, Jane cooked their dinner in the microwave oven and without realizing it, cooked her fiancé's wallet as well. Imagine their dismay when they found a beautifully-cooked wallet and notes turned to ash! John went to see his bank manager who sent the remains of wallet and the money to the special department of the Bank of England in Newcastle: the Mutilated Ladies! They examined the remains and John got all his money back. ‘So long as there's something to identify, we will give people their money back, ’said a spokeswoman for the Bank. ‘Last year, we paid ￡ 1. 5m on 21, 000 claims. ’

\* Damaged bank notes. The Queen's head appears on English bank notes，and‘lady’refers to this.

**Notes on the text 课文注释**

1 Mutilated ladies，这是英国银行专门负责识别和鉴定残缺或被毁纸币的小组，其中的 lady是指英国纸币上印的女王头像。
2 a large bank note，面额很大的纸币。
3 whiter than white，这是英国有关洗衣粉的电视广告中常用的一句话。这里的意思是纸币上的字迹、图案均被洗掉了，可以译为“比白纸还白”。
4 they found a beautifully-cooked wallet and notes turned to ash，他们发现一只煮得很好看的钱包，钞票已烧成了灰。后半句 they found… notes turned to ash中过去分词短语 turned to ash作宾语 notes的补足语，这后半句话可以看成 they found… that notes had been turned to ash。

**参考译文**

这种事情在你身上出现过吗？你有没有把裤子塞进**洗衣机**，然后又**想**起在裤子的**后兜**有一张大面值的纸币？当你把裤子**抢救**出来时，你有没有发现那张纸币已经变得比白纸还白？当英国人犯这种错误时，他们不必**感到绝望**（而许多国家的人都有这种绝望的感觉）。对英国人来说，值得庆幸的是英国银行有一个残钞鉴别组，**负责处理**那些把钱塞进机器或塞给狗的**人提出的**索赔要求。看起来，狗很喜欢咀嚼钱币。

Has it happen to you? 

Have you ever put your trousers in the  washing machine and then remembered there was a large bank note in your pocket.   

When you  **rescued** your trousers,  did you find  the note  was whiter than white?

When people in Britain made these mistakes, they needn't  despair  （however a lot of people do）。

Fortunately for them， the bank  of England  has  a team called  Mutilated Ladies，which **deals with**  claims from people  who fed their money to  a  machine or their dog。

## Lesson 8 A famous monastery 著名的修道院



The Great St. Bernard Pass connects Switzerland to Italy. At 2, 473 metres, it is the highest mountain pass in Europe. The famous monastery of St. Bernard, which was founded in the eleventh century, lies about a mile away. For hundreds of years, St. Bernard dogs have saved the lives of travellers crossing the dangerous Pass. These friendly dogs, which were first brought from Asia, were used as watchdogs even in Roman times. **Now that** a tunnel has been built through the mountains, the Pass is less dangerous, but each year, the dogs are still sent out into the snow whenever a traveller is in difficulty. Despite the new tunnel, there are still a few people who rashly attempt to cross the Pass on foot.

During the summer months, the monastery is very busy, for it is visited by thousands of people who cross the Pass in cars. As there are so many people about, the dogs have to be kept in a special enclosure. In winter, however, life at the monastery is quite different. The temperature drops to-30°and very few people attempt to cross the Pass. The monks prefer winter to summer for they have more privacy. The dogs have greater freedom, too, for they are allowed to wander outside their enclosure. The only regular visitors to the monastery in winter are parties of skiers who go there at Christmas and Easter. These young people, who love the peace of the mountains, always receive a warm welcome at St. Bernard's monastery.

## Lesson 9 Flying cats 飞猫


How do cats try to protect themselves when falling from great heights?

Cats never fail to fascinate human beings. They can be friendly and **affectionate** towards humans, but they **lead** mysterious lives of their own as well. They never become **submissive** like dogs and horses. As a result, humans have learned to respect **feline** independence. Most cats remain **suspicious** of humans all their lives. One of the things that fascinates us most about cats is the popular belief that they have nine lives. Apparently, there is **a good deal of** truth in this idea. A cat's ability to survive falls is based on fact.

Recently the New York Animal Medical Centre made a study of 132 cats over a period of five months. All these cats had one experience in common: they had fallen off high buildings, **yet** only eight of them died from shock or injuries. Of course, New York is the ideal place for such an interesting study, because there is **no shortage of** tall buildings. There are plenty of **high-rise** **windowsills** to fall, from! One cat, Sabrina, fell 32 **storeys**, yet only **suffered from** a broken tooth. ‘Cats behave like well-trained **paratroopers**, ’ a doctor said. It seems that the further cats fall, the less they **are likely to** injure themselves. In a long drop, they reach speeds of 60 miles an hour and more. At high speeds, falling cats have time to relax. They stretch out their legs like flying squirrels. This increases their air-resistance and reduces the shock of impact when they hit the ground.

**Notes on the text 课文注释**

1 Cats never fail to fascinate human beings. 在这句话中有一个否定词 never和一个含有否定意义的动词 fail，这两个否定词就组成了双重否定，而双重否定往往用来表示肯定。这句话可以译成：“猫总能引起人们的极大兴趣。”
2 be based on，在……基础之上。
3 have in common，有共同之处。
4 the further cats fall, the less they are likely to injure themselves，猫跌落的距离越长，它们就越不会伤害自己。“the +形容词或副词比较级…the +形容词或副词比较级”的结构常用来表示比较关系，往往可以译成“越……越……”。 be likely to是“很可能会”的意思。

**参考译文**

猫总能引起人们的极大兴趣。它们可以**对人**友好，充满柔情。但是，它们又有自己神秘的生活方式。它们从不**像**狗和马一样变得那么顺从。**结果是**人们已经学会尊重猫的独立性。**在它们的一生中**，大多数猫都**对**人存有戒心。最使我们**感兴趣**的一件事情就是一种**通俗的信念**——猫有九条命。显然，这种**说法**里面包含着许多真实性。猫在跌落时能够**大难不死**是有事实作为依据的。

## Lesson 10 The loss of the Titanic ＂泰坦尼克＂号的沉没


What would have happened if only two of the sixteen water-tight compartments had been flooded?

The great ship, Titanic, **sailed for** New York from Southampton on April 10th, 1912. She was carrying 1, 316 passengers and a crew of 891. Even by modern standards, the 46, 000 ton Titanic was a **colossal** ship**. At that time**, however, she was not only the largest ship that had ever been built, but was regarded as unsinkable, for she had sixteen **watertight** **compartments**. Even if two of these were **flooded**, she would still be able to float. The tragic sinking of this great **liner** will always be remembered, for she went down on her first **voyage** with heavy loss of life.

Four days after **setting out**, while the Titanic was sailing across the icy waters of the North Atlantic, a huge iceberg was suddenly spotted by a lookout. After the alarm had been given, the great ship turned **sharply** to avoid a direct collision. The Titanic turned just in time, **narrowly** missing the immense wall of ice which rose over 100 feet out of the water beside her. Suddenly, there was a **slight** **trembling** sound from below, and the captain went down to see what had happened. The noise had been so **faint** that no one thought that the ship had been damaged. Below, the captain realized to his **horror** that the Titanic was sinking rapidly, for five of her sixteen watertight compartments had already been flooded! The order to abandon ship was given and hundreds of people **plunged** into the icy water. As there were not enough lifeboats for everybody, 1, 500 lives were lost.

## Lesson 11 Not guilty 无罪


What was the Customs Officer looking for?



Customs Officers are quite tolerant these days, but they can still stop you when you are going through the Green Channel and have nothing to declare. Even really honest people are often made to feel guilty. The hardened professional smuggler, on the other hand, is never troubled by such feelings, even if he has five hundred gold watches hidden in his suitcase. When I returned from abroad recently, a particularly officious young Customs Officer clearly regarded me as a smuggler.

‘Have you anything to declare? ’ he asked, looking me in the eye.
‘No, ’ I answered confidently.
‘Would you mind unlocking （mind 后面一般加动名词）this suitcase please? ’
‘Not at all, ’ I answered.

The Officer went through the case with great care. All the things I had packed so carefully were soon in a dreadful mess. I felt sure I would never be able to close the case again. Suddenly, I saw the Officer's face light, up. He had spotted a tiny bottle at the bottom of my case and he pounced on it with delight.

‘Perfume, eh? ’ he asked sarcastically. ‘You should have declared that. Perfume is not exempt from import duty. ’
‘But it isn't perfume, ’ I said. ‘It's hair gel. ’ Then I added with a smile, ‘It's a strange mixture I make myself. ’
As I expected, he did not believe me.
‘Try it!’I said encouragingly.

The Officer unscrewed the cap and put the bottle to his nostrils. He was greeted by an unpleasant smell which convinced him that I was telling the truth. A few minutes later, I was able to hurry away with precious chalk marks on my baggage.

1 the Green Channel，绿色通道，指海关专供没有携带征税物品进关的旅客所走的通道。
2 hidden in his suitcase是过去分词短语作定语，修饰watches，它相当于一个定语从句：which were hidden in his suitcase.
3 looking me in the eye，直盯着我的眼睛，这是分词短语作状语，表示方式，修饰 asked。

4 The officer went through，这里go through作“检查”讲。
5 in a dreadful mess （或 in a mess），乱七八糟，混乱透了。
6 I saw the Officer's face light up．我看到那位官员的脸上露出了得意的神色。 在使用使役动词（如 "make"、"let"）或感官动词（如 "see"、"hear"、"watch"，看到你做了，那你已经做了，所以可以去掉to，to有将来的意思）时，后面的动词通常用原形。light up 是宾语补语



I saw the Officer's face lighting up表示一个时刻

I saw the Officer's face light up 表示过程



7 You should have declared that．你早该申报了。“should +不定式的完成式”表示本该做而未做之事。
8 be exempt from 作“免除”、“豁免”解。



使役动词let，make，have等，感官动词see，hear，feel，watch，notice，look at，listen to等，后常跟不带to的不定式作宾语补足语。例如：

## Lesson 12 Life on a desert island 荒岛生活


What was exceptional about the two men's stay on the desert island?

Most of us have formed an unrealistic picture of life on a desert island. We sometimes imagine a desert island to be a sort of paradise where the sun always shines. Life there is simple and good. Ripe fruit falls from the trees and you never have to work. **The other side of the picture is quite the opposite**. Life on a desert island is wretched. You either starve to death or live like Robinson Crusoe, waiting for a boat which never comes. Perhaps there is an element of truth in both these pictures, but few of us have had the opportunity to find out.

Two men who recently spent five days on a coral island wished they had stayed there longer. They were taking a badly damaged boat from the Virgin Islands to Miami to have it repaired. During the journey, their boat began to sink. They quickly loaded a small rubber dinghy with food, matches, and cans of beer and rowed for a few miles across the Caribbean until they arrived at a tiny coral island. There were hardly any trees on the island and there was no water, but this did not prove to be a problem. The men collected rainwater in the rubber dinghy. As they had brought a spear gun with them, they had plenty to eat. Theycaught lobster and fish every day, and, as one of them put it ‘ate like kings’. When a passing tanker rescued them five days later, both men were genuinely sorry that they had to leave.

## Lesson 13 It's only me 是我，别害怕

What did the man expect to find under the stairs?

After her husband had gone to work, Mrs. Richards sent her children to school and went upstairs to her bedroom. She was too excited to do any housework that morning, **for in the evening she would be going to** a fancy-dress party with her husband. She intended to dress up as a ghost and as she had made her costume the night before, she was impatient to try it on. Though the costume consisted only of a sheet, it was very effective. After putting it on, Mrs Richards went downstairs. She wanted to find out whether it would be comfortable to wear.

Just as Mrs. Richards was entering the dining room, there was a knock on the front door. She knew that it must be the baker. She had told him to come straight in if ever she failed to open the door and to leave the bread on the kitchen table. Not wanting to frighten the poor man, Mrs Richards quickly hid in the small storeroom under the stairs. She heard the front door open and heavy footsteps in the hall. Suddenly the door of the storeroom was opened and a man entered, Mrs Richards realized that it must be the man from the Electricity Board who had come to read the metre. She tried to explain the situation, saying‘It's only me’, but it was too late. The man let out a cry and jumped back **several paces**. When Mrs. Richards walked towards him, he fled, slamming the door behind him.

## Lesson 14: A noble **gangster **  贵族歹徒



How did Hawkwood make money in times of peace?

There was a time when the owners of shops and businesses in Chicago

had to pay large sums of money to gangsters in return for 'protection'.

If the money was not paid promptly,

the gangsters would quickly put a man out of business by destroying his shop.

Obtaining 'protection money' is not a modern crime.

As long ago as the fourteenth century,

an Englishman, Sir John Hawkwood,

made the remarkable discovery that people would rather pay large sums of money than have their life work destroyed by gangsters.





Six hundred years ago,

Sir John Hawkwood arrived in Italy with a band of soldiers and settled near Florence.

He soon made a name for himself and came to be known to the Italians as Giovanni Acuto.

Whenever the Italian city-states were at war with each other,

Hawkwood used to hire his soldiers to princes who were willing to pay the high price he demanded.

In times of peace, when business was bad,

Hawkwood and his men would march into a city-state,

and after burning down a few farms, would offer to go away if protection money was paid to them.

Hawkwood made large sums of money in this way.

In spite of this, the Italians regarded him as a sort of hero.

When he died at the age of eighty,

the Florentines gave him a state funeral and had a picture painted which was dedicated to the memory of 'the most valiant soldier and most notable leader, Signor Giovanni Haukodue'.

## Lesson 15 Fifty pence worth of trouble



Did George get anything for his fifty pence? What?

Children always appreciate small gifts of money.

Mum or dad, of course, provides a regular supply of pocket money,

but uncles and aunts are always a source of extra income.

With some children, small sums go a long way.

If fifty pence pieces are not exchanged for sweets,

they rattle for months inside money boxes.

Only very thrifty children manage to fill up a money box.

For most of them, fifty pence is a small price to pay for a nice big bar of chocolate.

My nephew, George, has a money box but it is always empty.

Very few of the fifty pence pieces and pound coins I have given him have found their way there.

I gave him fifty pence yesterday and advised him to save it.

Instead, he bought himself **fifty pence worth of trouble.**

On his way to the sweet shop,

he dropped his fifty pence and it bounced along the pavement and then disappeared down a drain.

George took off his jacket,

rolled up his sleeves and pushed his right arm through the drain cover.

He could not find his 50 pence piece anywhere, and what is more, he could not get his arm out.

A crowd of people gathered round him and a lady rubbed his arm with soap and butter,

but George was firmly stuck.

The fire brigade was called and two fire fighters **freed** George using a special type of grease.

George was not too upset by his experience,

because the lady who owns the sweet shop heard about his troubles and rewarded him with a large box of chocolates.

## Lesson 16 Mary had a little lamb



Was Dimitri right to apologize to his neighbour? Why not?



Mary and her husband Dimitri lived in the tiny village of Perachora in southern Greece.

One of Mary's prize possessions was a little white lamb which her husband had given her.

She kept it tied to a tree in a field during the day and went to fetch it every evening.

One evening, however the lamb was missing.

The rope had been cut, so it was obvious that the lamb had been stolen.

When Dimitri came in from the fields, his wife told him what had happened.

Dimitri at once set out to find the thief.

He knew it would not prove difficult in such a small village.

After telling several of his friends about the theft,

Dimitri found out that his neighbour, Aleko, had suddenly acquired a new lamb.

Dimitri immediately went to Aleko's house and angrily accused him of stealing the lamb.

He told him he had better return it or he would call the police.

Aleko denied taking it and led Dimitri into his backyard.

It was true that he had just bought a lamb he explained,

but his lamb was black.

Ashamed of having acted so rashly, Dimitri apologized to Aleko for having accused him.

While they were talking it began to rain and Dimitri stayed in Aleko's house until the rain stopped.

When he went outside half an hour later,

he was astonished to find that the little black lamb was almost white.

Its wool, which had been dyed black,

had been washed clean by the rain!

迪米特里从地里回来，妻子把情况跟他一说，他马上出去找偷羔羊的人。他知道在这样一个小村庄里抓住小偷并不困难。把失窃的事告诉几个朋友后，迪米特里发出他的邻居阿列科家突然**多**了一只小羔羊。迪米特里立刻去了阿列科家，气呼呼地指责他偷了羔羊，告诉他最好把羊交还，否则就去叫警察。阿列科不承认，并把迪米特里领进院子。**不错**，他的确刚买了一只羔羊，阿列科解释说，但他的羔羊是黑色的。迪米特里为自己的鲁莽而感到不好意思，向阿列科道了歉，说是错怪了他。就在他俩说话的时候，天下起了雨，迪米特里便呆在阿列科家里**避雨**，一直等到雨停为止。半小时后，当他从屋里出来时，他惊奇地发现小黑羔羊全身几乎都变成白色。原来羊毛上染的黑色被雨水冲掉了！

When Dimitri came in from the fields, his wife told him what had happened.

Dimitri at once set out to find the thief.

He knew it would not prove difficult in such a small village. 

After telling several of his friends about the theft,Dimitri found out that his neighbour, Aleko, had suddenly **acquired** a new lamb.

Dimitri immediately went to Aleko's house and angrily accused him of stealing the lamb.

He told him he had better return it or he would call the police.

Aleko denied taking it and **led Dimitri into his backyard.**

**It was true** that he had just bought a lamb he explained,but his lamb was black.



Ashamed of **having acted** so rashly, Dimitri apologized to Aleko for **having accused** him.

While they were talking it began to rain and Dimitri stayed in Aleko's house until the rain stopped.



When he went outside half an hour later,he was astonished to find that the little black lamb was almost white.

Its wool, which had been dyed black,had been washed clean by the rain!















## Lesson 17 The longest suspension bridge in the world



The longest suspension bridge in the world

How is the bridge supported?

Verrazano, an Italian about whom little is known,sailed into New York Harbour in 1524 and named it Angouleme.

He described it as 'a very agreeable situation located within two small hills in the midst of which flowed a great river.'

Though Verrazano is by no means considered to be a great explorer, his name will probably remain immortal,for on November 21st, 1964, the longest suspension bridge in the world was named after him.

The Verrazano Bridge, which was designed by Othmar Ammann, joins Brooklyn to Staten Island.

It has a span of 4, 260 feet.

The bridge is so long that the shape of the earth **had to be taken into account** by its designer.

Two great towers support four huge cables.

The towers are built on immense underwater platforms made of steel and concrete.

The platforms extend to a depth of over 100 feet under the sea.

These alone took sixteen months to build.

Above the surface of the water, the towers rise to a height of nearly 700 feet.

They support the cables from which the bridge has been suspended.

Each of the four cables contains 26, 108 lengths of wire.

It has been estimated that if the bridge were packed with cars,

it would still only be carrying a third of its total capacity.

However, size and strength are not the only important things about this bridge.

Despite its immensity, it is both simple and elegant,

fulfilling its designer's dream to creat 'an enormous object drawn as faintly as possible'.

## Lesson 18  Electric currents in modern art  现代艺术的电流



How might some of the exhibits have been dangerous?



might  + have been  





Modern sculpture rarely surprises us any more.

The idea that modern art can only be seen in museums is **mistaken**.

**Even people who take no interest in art cannot have failed to notice examples of modern sculpture on display in public places.**

Strange forms stand in gardens, and outside buildings and shops.

We have got quite used to them.

Some **so-called** 'modern' pieces have been on display for nearly eighty years.







In spite of this, some people--including myself--were surprised by a recent exhibition of modern sculpture.

The first thing I saw when I entered the art gallery was a notice which said:

'Do not touch the exhibits, some of them are dangerous!'

The objects on display were pieces of moving sculpture.

**Oddly** shaped forms that are suspended from the ceiling

and move in response to a gust of wind are quite familiar to everybody.

These objects, however, were different.

Lined up against the wall, there were long thin wires attached to metal spheres.

The spheres had been magnetized and attracted or repelled each other all the time.

In the centre of the hall,

there were a number of tall structures which contained coloured lights.

These lights **flickered** continuously like traffic lights which have gone mad.

Sparks were emitted from small black boxes and red lamps flashed on and off angrily.

It was rather like an exhibition of **prehistoric** electronic equipment.

These **peculiar** forms not only seemed designed to shock people emotionally,

but to give them electric shocks as well!

## Lesson 19  A very dear cat



Why was Rastus 'very dear' in more ways than one?

Kidnappers are rarely interested in animals,but they recently took considerable interest in Mrs. Eleanor Ramsay's cat.

Mrs. Eleanor Ramsay, a very wealthy old lady,has shared a flat with her cat, Rastus, for a great many years.

Rastus leads an orderly life.

He usually takes a short walk in the evenings and is always home by seven o'clock.

One evening, however he failed to arrive.

Mrs. Ramsay got very worried.

She looked everywhere for him but could not find him.

Three days after Rastus' disappearance,

Mrs. Ramsay received an anonymous letter.

The writer stated that Rastus was **in safe hands** and would be returned immediately if Mrs. Ramsay paid a ransom of $1,000.

Mrs.Ramsay was instructed to place the money in a cardboard box and to leave it outside her door.

At first, she decided to go to the police,

but fearing that she would never see Rastus again--the letter had made that quite clear--she changed her mind.

She **withdrew** $1000 from her bank and followed the kidnapper's instructions.

The next morning, the box had disappeared but Mrs.Ramsay was sure that the kidnapper would keep his word.

Sure enough, Rastus arrived **punctually** at seven o'clock that evening.

He looked very well, though he was rather thirsty,for he drank half a bottle of milk.

The police were **astounded** when Mrs. Ramsay told them what she had done.

She explained that Rastus was very dear to her.

Considering the amount she paid,he was dear in more ways than one!

## Lesson 20  Pioneer pilots



What was the name of the first plane to fly across the English Channel?



In 1908 Lord Northcliffe offered a prize of $1,000 to the first man who would fly across the English Channel.

Over a year passed before the first attempt was made.

On July 19th, 1909, in the early morning,Hubert Latham took off from the French coast in his plane the 'Antoinette IV.'

He had travelled only seven miles across the Channel when his engine failed and he was forced to land on the sea.

The 'Antoinette' floated on the water until Latham was picked up by a ship.

Two days later, Louis Bleriot arrived near Calais with a plane called 'No.XI'.

Bleriot had been making planes since 1905 and this was his latest model.

A week before, he had completed a successful overland flight during which he covered twenty-six miles.

Latham, however, did not give up easily.

He, too, arrived near Calais on the same day with a new 'Antoinette'.

It looked as if there would be an exciting race across the Channel.

Both planes were going to take off on July 25th,but Latham failed to get up early enough.

After making a short test flight at 4.15 a.m., Bleriot **set off** half an hour later.

His great flight lasted thirty-seven minutes.

When he landed near Dover, the first person to greet him was a local policeman.

Latham made another attempt a week later and got within half a mile of Dover,

but he was unlucky again.

His engine failed and he landed on the sea for the second time.

## Lesson 21 Daniel Mendoza



How many unsuccessful attempts did Mendoza make before becoming Champion of all England?



Boxing matches were very popular in England two hundred years ago.

In those days, boxers fought with bare **fists** for prize money.

Because of this, they were known as 'prizefighters'.

However, boxing was very crude,

for there were no rules and a prizefighter could be seriously injured or even killed during a match.







One of the most colourful figures in boxing history was Daniel Mendoza, who was born in 1764.

The use of gloves was not introduced until 1860,when the Marquis of Queensberry drew up the first set of rules.

Though he was technically a prizefighter,Mendoza did much to change crude prizefighting into a sport,for he brought science to the game.

In his day, Mendoza enjoyed tremendous popularity.

He was adored by rich and poor alike.





Mendoza rose to fame swiftly after a boxing match when he was only fourteen years old.

This attracted the attention of Richard Humphries who was then the most **eminent** boxer in England.

He offered to train Mendoza and his young pupil was quick to learn.

In fact, Mendoza soon became so successful that Humphries turned against him.

The two men quarrelled bitterly and it was clear that the argument could only **be settled** by a fight.

A match was held at Stilton,where both men fought for an hour.

The public bet a great deal of money on Mendoza, but he was defeated.

Mendoza met Humphries **in the ring** on a later occasion and he lost for a second time.

It was not until his third match in 1790 that he finally beat Humphries and became Champion of England.

Meanwhile, he founded a highly successful Academy and even Lord Byron became one of his pupils.

He earned enormous **sums** of money and was paid as much as $100 for a single appearance.

Despite this, he was so **extravagant** that he was always in debt.

After he was defeated by a boxer called Gentleman Jackson, he was quickly forgotten.

He was sent to prison for failing to pay his debts and died in poverty in 1836.

参考译文
  两百年前，拳击比赛在英国非常盛行。当时，拳击手们不戴手套，为争夺奖金而搏斗。因此，他们被称作“职业拳击手”。不过，拳击是十分野蛮的，因为当时没有任何比赛规则，职业拳击手有可能在比赛中受重伤，甚至丧命。
  拳击史上最引人注目的人物之一是丹尼尔.门多萨，他生于1764年。1860年昆斯伯里侯爵第一次为拳击比赛制定了规则，拳击比赛这才用上了手套。虽然门多萨严格来讲不过是个职业拳击手，但在把这种粗野的拳击变成一种体育运动方面，他作出了重大贡献。是他把科学引进了这项运动。门多萨在的全盛时期深受大家欢迎，无论是富人还是穷人都对他祟拜备至。

Boxing matches were very popular in England two hundred years ago.

In those days, boxers fought with bare fists for prize money.

Because of this, they were known as 'prizefighters'.

However, boxing was very crude,

for there were no rules and a prizefighter could be seriously injured or even killed during a match.

One of the most colourful figures in boxing history was Daniel Mendoza, who was born in 1764.

The use of gloves was not introduced until 1860,when the Marquis of Queensberry drew up the first set of rules.

Though he was technically a prizefighter,Mendoza did much to change crude prizefighting into a sport,

for he brought science to the game.

In his day, Mendoza enjoyed tremendous popularity.He was adored by rich and poor alike.



   门多萨在14岁时参加一场拳击赛后一举成名。这引起当时英国拳坛名将理查德.汉弗莱斯的注意。他主动提出教授门多萨，而年少的门多萨一学就会。事实上，门多萨不久便名声大振，致使汉弗莱斯与他反目为敌。两个人争吵不休，显而易见，只有较量一番才能解决问题。于是两人在斯蒂尔顿设下赛场，厮打了一个小时。公众把大笔赌注下到了门多萨身上，但他却输了。后来，门多萨与汉弗莱斯再次在拳击场上较量，门多萨又输了一场。直到1790年他们第3次对垒，门多萨才终于击败汉弗莱斯，成了全英拳击冠军。同时，他建立了一所拳击学校，办得很成功，连拜伦勋爵也成了他的学生。门多萨挣来大笔大笔的钱，一次出场费就多可达100英镑。尽管收入不少，但他挥霍无度，经常债台高筑。他在被一个叫杰克逊绅士的拳击手击败后很快被遗忘。他因无力还债而被捕入狱，最后于1836年在贫困中死去。

Mendoza rose to fame swiftly after a boxing match when he was only fourteen years old.

This attracted the attention of Richard Humphries who was then the most eminent boxer in England.

He offered to train Mendoza and his young pupil was quick to learn.

In fact, Mendoza soon became so successful that Humphries turned against him.

The two men quarrelled bitterly and it was clear that the argument could only be settled by a fight.

A match was held at Stilton,where both men fought for an hour.

The public bet a great deal of money on Mendoza, but he was defeated.

Mendoza met Humphries in the ring on a later occasion and he lost for a second time.

It was not until his third match in 1790 that he finally beat Humphries and became Champion of England.







Meanwhile, he founded a highly successful Academy and even Lord Byron became one of his pupils.

He earned enormous sums of money and was paid as much as $100 for a single appearance.

Despite this, he was so extravagant that he was always in debt.

After he was defeated by a boxer called Gentleman Jackson, he was quickly forgotten.

He was sent to prison for failing to pay his debts and died in poverty in 1836.

## Lesson 22 By heart



Which actor read the letter in the end, the aristocrat or the gaoler?



Some plays are so successful that they run for years on end.

In many ways, this is unfortunate for the poor actors who are required to go on repeating the same lines night after night.

One would expect them to know their parts by heart and never have cause to falter.

Yet this is not always the case.





A famous actor in a highly successful play was once cast in the role of an aristocrat who had been imprisoned in the Bastille for twenty years.

In the last act, a gaoler would always come on to the stage with a letter which he would hand to the prisoner.

Even though the noble was expected to read the letter at each performance,he always insisted that it should be written out in full.

One night, the gaoler decided to play a joke on his colleague to find out if,

after so many performances, he had managed to learn the contents of the letter by heart.

The curtain went up on the final act of the play and revealed the aristocrat sitting alone behind bars in his dark cell.

Just then, the gaoler appeared with the precious letter in his hands.

He entered the cell and presented the letter to the aristocrat.

But the copy he gave him had not been written out in full as usual.

It was simply a blank sheet of paper.

The gaoler **looked on** eagerly, anxious to see if his fellow actor had at last learnt his lines.

The noble stared at the blank sheet of paper for a few seconds.

Then, **squinting** his eyes, he said: 'The light is **dim**. Read the letter to me.'

And he promptly handed the sheet of paper to the gaoler.

Finding that he could not remember a word of the letter either,

the gaoler replied: 'The light is indeed dim, sire. I must get my glasses. '

With this, he hurried off the stage.

Much to the aristocrat's amusement,the gaoler returned a few moments later

with a pair of glasses and the usual copy of the letter which he **proceeded** to read to the prisoner.

有一位名演员曾在一出极为成功的剧目中扮演一个贵族角色，这个贵族已在巴士底狱被关押了20年。在最后一幕中，狱卒手持一封信上场，然后将信交给狱中那位贵族。尽管那个贵族每场戏都得念一遍那封信。但他还是坚持要求将信的全文写在信纸上。

## Lesson 23 One man's meat is another man's poison





What was it about snails that made the writer collect them for his friend on that day in particular?

People become quite illogical when they try to decide what can be eaten and what cannot be eaten.

If you lived in the Mediterranean, for instance, you would consider octopus a great delicacy.

You would not be able to understand why some people find it repulsive.

On the other hand,your stomach would turn at the idea of frying potatoes in animal fat-the normally accepted practice in many northern countries.

The sad truth is that most of us have been brought up to eat certain foods and we stick to them all our lives.



No creature has received more praise and abuse than the common garden snail.

Cooked in wine, snails are a great luxury in various parts of the world.

There are countless people who,ever since their early years, have learned to associate snails with food.

My friend, Robert, lives in a country where snails are **despised**.

As his flat is in a large town, he has no garden of his own.

For years he has been asking me to collect snails from my garden and take them to him.

The idea never appealed to me very much, but one day, after a heavy shower,

I happened to be walking in my garden when I noticed a huge number of snails taking a stroll on some of my prize plants.

Acting on a sudden impulse,I collected several dozen, put them in a paper bag, and took them to Robert.

Robert was delighted to see me and equally pleased with my little gift.

I left the bag in the hall and Robert and I went into the living room where we talked for a couple of hours.

I had forgotten all about the snails when Robert suddenly said that I must stay to dinner.

Snails would, of course, be the main dish.

I did not fancy the idea and I reluctantly followed Robert out of the room.

To our dismay,we saw that there were snails everywhere:

they had escaped from the paper bag and had taken complete possession of the hall!

 I have never be able to look at a snail since then

  没有一种生物所受到的赞美和厌恶会超过花园里常见的蜗牛了。蜗牛加酒烧煮后，便成了世界上许多地方的一道珍奇的名菜。有**不计其数的**人们**从小**就知道蜗牛可做菜。但我的朋友罗伯特却住在一个**厌恶**蜗牛的国家中。他住在大城市里的一所公寓里，没有自己的花园。**多年来**，他一直让我把我园子里的蜗牛收集起来给他捎去。一开始，他的这一想法没有**引起**我多大兴趣。后来有一天，一场大雨后，我在花园里**漫无目的**散步，突然注意到许许多多蜗牛在我的一些**心爱的**花木上慢悠悠的**蠕动**着。**我一时冲动**，逮了几十只，装进一只纸袋里，带着去找罗伯特。罗伯特见到我很高兴，对我的薄礼也感到满意。我把纸袋**放**在门厅里，与罗伯特一起进了起居室，在那里聊了**好几个**钟头。我把蜗牛**的事**已**忘得一干二净**，罗伯特突然提出一定要我留下来吃晚饭，这才提醒了我。蜗牛当然是道主菜。我并不喜欢这个主意，所以我勉强跟着罗伯特走进了起居室。使我们惊愕的是门厅里到处爬满了蜗牛：它们从纸袋里逃了出来，爬得满厅都是！从那以后，我再也不能看一眼蜗牛了。

## Lesson 24 A skeleton in the cupboard



Who was Sebastian?



We often read in novels how a seemingly respectable person or family

has some terrible secret which has been concealed from strangers for years.

The English language possesses a vivid saying to describe this sort of situation.

The terrible secret is called 'a skeleton in the cupboard'.

At some dramatic moment in the story,

the terrible secret becomes known and a reputation is ruined.

The reader's hair stands on end when he reads in the final pages of the novel that the heroine,

a dear old lady who had always been so kind to everybody, had, in her youth, poisoned every one of her five husbands.

It is all very well for such things to occur in fiction.

To varying degrees,we all have secrets which we do not want even our closest friends to learn,

but few of us have skeletons in the cupboard.

The only person I know who has a skeleton in the cupboard is George Carlton, and he is very proud of the fact.

George studied medicine in his youth.

Instead of becoming a doctor, however, he became a successful writer of detective stories.

I once spent an uncomfortable weekend which I shall never forget at his house.

George showed me to the guestroom which, he said, was rarely used.

He told me to unpack my things and then come down to dinner.

After I had stacked my shirts and underclothes in two empty drawers,

I decided to hang one of the two suits I had brought with me in the cupboard.

I opened the cupboard door and then stood in front of it petrified.

A skeleton was dangling before my eyes.

The sudden movement of the door made it sway slightly and it gave me the impression that it was about to leap out at me.

Dropping my suit, I dashed downstairs to tell George.

This was worse than 'a terrible secret'; this was a real skeleton!

But George was unsympathetic.'Oh, that,' he said with a smile as if he were talking about an old friend.

'That's Sebastian.You forget that I was a medical student once upon a time.'

## Lesson 25 The Cutty Sark



What piece of bad luck prevented the Cutty Sark from winning the race?



One of the most famous sailing ships of the nineteenth century, the Cutty Sark, can still be seen at Greenwich.

She stands on dry land and is visited by thousands of people each year.

She **serves as an impressive reminder** of the great ships of the past.

Before they were replaced by steamships,sailing vessels like the Cutty Sark were used to carry tea from China and wool from Australia.

The Cutty Sark was one of the fastest sailing ships that has ever been built.

The only other ship to match her was the Thermopylae.

Both these ships set out from Shanghai on June 18th, 1872 on an exciting race to England.

This race, which went on for exactly four months, was the last of its kind.

It marked the end of the great tradition of ships with sails and the beginning of a new era.



The first of the two ships to reach Java after the race had begun was the Thermopylae,

but on the Indian Ocean, the Cutty Sark took the lead.

It seemed certain that she would be the first ship home,but during the race she had a lot of bad luck.

In August, she was struck by a very heavy storm during which her rudder was torn away.

The Cutty Sark rolled from side to side and it became impossible to steer her.

A temporary rudder was made on board from spare planks and it was fitted with great difficulty.

This greatly reduced the speed of the ship,for there was a danger that if she travelled too quickly,

this rudder would be torn away as well.

Because of this, the Cutty Sark lost her lead.

After crossing the Equator, the captain called in at a port to have a new rudder fitted,

but by now the Thermopylae was over five hundred miles ahead.

Though the new rudder was fitted at tremendous speed, it was impossible for the Cutty Sark to win.

She arrived in England a week after the Thermopylae.

Even this was remarkable, considering that she had had so many delays.

There is no doubt that if she had not lost her rudder she would have won the race easily.

人们在格林威治仍可看到19世纪最有名的帆船之一"卡蒂萨克"号。它**停**在陆地上，每年接待成千上万的参观者。它给人们留下深刻的印象，使人们回忆起历史上的巨型帆船。在蒸汽船取代帆船之前，"卡蒂萨克"号**之类的**帆船被用来从中国运回茶叶，从澳大利亚运回羊毛。"卡蒂萨克"号是帆船制造史上建造的最快的一艘帆船。唯一可以与之一比高低的是"塞姆皮雷"号帆船。两船于1872年6月18日同时从上海启航驶往英国，途中**展开了**一场激烈的比赛。这场比赛**持续了**整整4个月，是这类比赛中的最后一次，它**标志**着帆船伟大传统的结束与一个新纪元的开始。

比赛开始后，"赛姆皮雷"号率先抵达爪哇岛。但在印度洋上，"卡萨萨克"号驶到了前面。看来，它首先返抵英国是确信无疑的了，但它却在比赛中连遭厄运。8月份"卡蒂萨克"号遭到一场特大风暴的袭击，失去了一只舵。船身左右摇晃，无法操纵。船员用备用的木板在船上赶制了一只应急用的舵，并克服重重困难将舵安装就位，这样一来，大大降低了船的航速。因为船不能开得太快，否则就有危险，应急舵也会被刮走。因为这个缘故，"卡蒂萨克"号落到了后面。跨越赤道后，船长将船停靠在一个港口，在那儿换了一只舵。但此时，"赛姆皮雷"号早已在500多英里之遥了。尽管换装新舵时分秒必争，但"卡蒂萨克"号已经不可能取胜了，它抵达英国时比"塞姆皮雷"号晚了1个星期。但考虑到路上的多次耽搁，这个成绩也已很不容易了。毫无疑问，如果中途没有失去舵， "卡帝萨克"号肯定能在比赛中轻易夺冠。





One of the most famous sailing ships of the nineteenth century, the Cutty Sark, can still be seen at Greenwich.

She stands on dry land and is visited by thousands of people each year.

She serves as an impressive reminder of the great ships of the past.

Before they were replaced by steamships,sailing vessels like the Cutty Sark were used to **carry** tea from China and wool from Australia.

The Cutty Sark was one of the fastest sailing ships that has ever been built.

The only other ship to match her was the Thermopylae.

Both these ships set out from Shanghai on June 18th, 1872 on an exciting race to England.

This race, which **went on** for exactly four months, was the last of its kind.

It marked the end of the great tradition of ships with sails and the beginning of a new era.
