帮我把下面用来做视频的脚本翻译成英文字母并润色。斗战神可以被翻译为 asura



视频标题  关于黑神话悟空你有可能不知道的几点内容。




距离黑神话悟空发售已经过去一个礼拜，如果你是不太了解中国文化的玩家，那你有可能会不知道以下的内容。



第一。bgm

屡次在预告片出现的背景乐来自 中国1982年中国中央电视台播出的《西游记》。黑神话的预告片中背景音是对这个版本西游记 的主题曲《云宫迅音》的变奏。

该剧讲述的是孙悟空  ，猪八戒、沙僧辅助保护大唐高僧玄奘去西天取经，师徒四人一路抢滩涉险，降妖伏怪，历经八十一难，取回真经，终成正果的故事。

该剧一经播出，获得了极高评价，成为一部公认的无法超越的经典。 曾经创造了中央电视台89.4%的最高收视率，重播超过3000次。也不难发现很多黑神话悟空视频下面都会有这首曲目的评论，确实是一代中国玩家们的记忆。用一句流行的话来说，这首歌的旋律已经刻在了中国玩家的DNA里。

二。场景

黑神话悟空的许多游戏场景都来源于中国各个地方的景区。并且还原度很高



三。斗战神（asura）

黑神话的主创在开发黑神话之前 ，还开发过《斗战神》。
《斗战神》是腾讯旗下的工作室开发，2010年发布的一款大型多人在线角色扮演游戏。
《斗战神》以今何在的小说《悟空传》为背景蓝本，游戏剧情原汁原味地呈现了小说的感染力，是该游戏的一大特色。
当年斗战神这款网游的品质在当年还是可以的。只不过之后运营不尽人意，但至今还在运营中。
但在这款游戏中，你能看到很多 黑神话悟空的美术风格。

Video Title: Things You Might Not Know About Black Myth: Wukong

It's been a week since the release of Black Myth: Wukong. If you're a player not too familiar with Chinese culture, you might not know the following points.

1. Background Music

The background music that repeatedly appears in the trailers comes from the 1982 Chinese TV series "Journey to the West," broadcast by China Central Television. The background music in Black Myth's trailers is a variation of the theme song "Yun Gong Xun Yin" from this version of "Journey to the West."

The series tells the story of Sun Wukong, Zhu Bajie, and Sha Wujing assisting the Tang Dynasty monk Xuanzang in his journey to the West to obtain sacred scriptures. The four of them face numerous dangers, defeat demons and monsters, endure 81 trials, and ultimately achieve their goal.

Upon its release, the series received high praise and became an undisputed classic. It once achieved a record-high viewership rating of 89.4% on China Central Television and has been replayed over 3,000 times. It's not surprising to see comments about this song under many Black Myth: Wukong videos, as it is indeed a memory for a generation of Chinese players. In a popular saying, the melody of this song is "engraved in the DNA of Chinese gamers."

2. Scenery

Many game scenes in Black Myth: Wukong are inspired by scenic spots across China, with a high degree of accuracy in their recreation.

3. Asura

Before developing Black Myth: Wukong, the main team behind the game also developed "Asura."

"Asura" is a massive multiplayer online role-playing game developed by a Tencent studio and released in 2010. The game is based on Jin Hezai's novel "Wukong Biography," and the storyline faithfully captures the novel's essence, which is one of the game's distinctive features.

At the time, "Asura" was considered a high-quality online game, though its operations later fell short of expectations. However, it is still in operation to this day. In this game, you can see many of the artistic styles that would later appear in Black Myth: Wukong.
