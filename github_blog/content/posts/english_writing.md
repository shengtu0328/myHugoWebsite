### Why i learned English

I recently watched some interesting videos on bilibli which is about communicating with foreigners in English on website. The videos was so funny that it made me have the idea of relearning the skill of  English language .

You know，i recently started to practise my english from multiple aspects 。Literally,my ultimate goal is to ''润''. Job is a crucial part in one's life. Although the chinese government have optimized covid-19 epidemic control policies,，the domestic software industry as well as other industries  are also gloomy overall。As my serveral programming years  passed ，I may have to face the  35 years old coders problems, which is discussed on the Internet popularly。In the fact ,I think my major developing skill is not very outstanding，so i want to learn english to promote myself .If  there wil be a chance to  work in  foreign firms in future，i may won't ignore it.

### Stepping out of one's comfort zone is a good thing

English in my daliy work is also helpful for me in reading technical tutorial ,articles, playing games as well as watching  film.You can clear the way through learning English once for all.

If you have a good command of English,it will be funny to commuicate with foreigners.  Actully,if you  really want to communicate with others，you can just  use Enlish grammer in middle school level and know some common vocabulariess, and you will get positive result through using English.



### Talk about the process of learning English 

From the beginning，i read China-daily website for servral days。During the reading，i met plenty of unkown words which made me confusing，so i wrote down the unknown words to remember it。Actually,the  vocabularies on the China-daily are mostly about economics and peoples's daily life ,so some unkonwn word repeated in many articles and  you will easy to remember these words.  After l learned some vocabularies,  i found it difficult for me to output some English. I think that writing and speaking is more  important comparing to reading since i was a stuednt in school .Because the examination in school  is basically about reading , speaking  is a small part  in English studying.  Only  you ouput the English, your english is really used.



Using the words which you learned as much as possible,

Last but not least, The fact that long persistence is  the only key to learn English well should always keeep in mind.



From the perspective of daily work.I think that the  several important points  of  learning English from high to low  is vocabulary>grammar>spoken language>listening>reading>writing. And In grammar, I think that the importance from high to low is  non predicate verb>preposition>subordinate_clause>other. In my opinion,subordinate clause is usually used in writing。
