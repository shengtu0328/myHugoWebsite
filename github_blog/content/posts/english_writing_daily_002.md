# Learning English is not a rocket science.

### Why I Learned English

I recently watched some interesting videos on Bilibili about **communicating with foreigners in English** on websites. The videos were so funny that they **sparked the idea** of relearning **the skill of the English** language in me.

我最近在哔哩哔哩上看了一些关于网站上**用英语与外国人交流**的有趣视频。 这些视频非常有趣，它们**激发了我重新学习**英语**语言的想法**。

Recently, I have **started practicing** my English from multiple aspects. Ultimately, my goal is to improve. Work is a crucial part of one's life. Although the Chinese government has optimized COVID-19 epidemic control policies, the **domestic software industry**, as well as other industries, are still **facing challenges overall**. As my years of programming experience **accumulate**, I may have to face the challenges **commonly discussed on the internet** about being a coder at the age of 35. In reality, I believe my development skills are not outstanding, so I want to learn English t**o enhance my professional profile**.  **If** there is an opportunity to work in foreign firms in the future, I **wouldn't** ignore it.

最近，我**开始从多个方面练习**我的英语。 最终，我的目标是进步。 工作是一个人生活的重要组成部分。 尽管中国政府优化了COVID-19疫情控制政策，但**国内软件行业**以及其他行业仍然**总体面临挑战**。 随着我多年编程经验的积累，35岁的我可能要面对**网络上常讨论的**程序员的挑战。事实上，我认为自己的开发能力并不突出，所以我想学习英语来提升我的专业水平**。 **如果**将来有在外企工作的机会，我**不会**忽视。



### Stepping Out of One's Comfort Zone is a Good Thing

English language skills **are also beneficial to** me in my daily work. They help me in reading **technical tutorials**, articles, playing games, and watching films. Learning English can **pave the way** for **various endeavors**.

英语语言技能**对我的日常工作也有好处**。 他们帮助我阅读**技术教程**、文章、玩游戏和看电影。 学习英语可以为**各种努力**铺平道路**。



If you have a good command of English, it can be enjoyable to communicate with foreigners. In fact, if you truly want to communicate with others, you can use English grammar **at a middle school level** and have knowledge of common vocabulary. By doing so, you can **achieve positive results** in your interactions.

如果你英语掌握得好，与外国人交流会很愉快。 事实上，如果你真的想与他人交流，你可以使用**中学水平**的英语语法并了解常用词汇。 通过这样做，您可以在互动中**取得积极的结果**。

### Reflecting on the Process of Learning English

Initially, I started by reading the China Daily website for several days. During my reading, I encountered **numerous unknown words** that confused me, so I wrote them down to remember them. The vocabulary on the China Daily website mainly **revolves around** economics and daily life, so some unknown words are repeated in many articles, making them easier to remember. After learning some vocabulary, I **found it challenging** to express myself in English. I believe that writing and speaking are more important than reading, as I have experienced during my time as a student. In school, examinations mostly focused on reading, with speaking being a minor aspect of English studies. **Only when** you actively use English by speaking and writing **can you** truly apply your language skills.

最初，我先看了几天中国日报网站。 在阅读过程中，我遇到了**很多不认识的单词**，让我很困惑，所以我把它们写下来以记住它们。 中国日报网站的词汇主要**围绕**经济和日常生活，因此很多文章中都会重复一些不认识的单词，这样更容易记住。 学习了一些词汇后，我**发现用英语表达自己很有挑战性**。 我相信写作和口语比阅读更重要，正如我在学生时代所经历的那样。 在学校，考试主要集中在阅读上，口语只是英语学习的一个次要方面。 **只有当**你通过说和写积极地使用英语时**你**才能真正运用你的语言技能。

Make an effort to utilize the words you have learned as much as possible.

努力尽可能多地利用您学到的单词。

Last but not least, always remember that persistence is the key to mastering the English language.

最后但并非最不重要的一点是，永远记住坚持是掌握英语的关键。

**From the perspective** of daily work, I believe that the key points of learning English, ranked from high to low, are vocabulary, grammar, spoken language, listening, reading, and writing. **In terms of** grammar, I consider non-predicate verbs, prepositions, subordinate clauses, and others as important components, ranked from high to low. Subordinate clauses are commonly used in writing, in my opinion.

**从日常工作的角度**，我认为学习英语的重点从高到低依次是词汇、语法、口语、听力、阅读、写作。 **在**语法方面，我认为非谓语动词、介词、从句等都是重要的组成部分，从高到低排列。 我认为从句通常用于书面形式
